Here is our step by step guide on how to make Snapchat lenses.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1"><strong>Part1: Comparing Lens Studio and Creating Your Own Lens</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part2"><strong>Part2: How to Use Lens Studio</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part3"><strong>Part3: How to Create Snapchat Lenses Using Create Your Own Lens</strong></a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-Comparing-Lens-Studio-and-Creating-Your-Own-Lens-3"><a href="#Part-1-Comparing-Lens-Studio-and-Creating-Your-Own-Lens-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Comparing Lens Studio and Creating Your Own Lens"></a>Part 1: Comparing Lens Studio and Creating Your Own Lens</h2><p>The two programs that we are highlighting today are Lens Studio and Create Your Own Lens. These are both fantastic programs for creating your own Snapchat lens, but they do have slightly different uses. If you are the type of person who wants to design a professional Snapchat lens, you are going to prefer Lens Studio.</p><p>But if you are hoping to come up with something creative that you can share with your friends and family, then you may love Create Your Own Lens. It is a very easy program to use, and it offers a ton of features that you may be surprised to see.</p><h4 id="Snapchat-lenses-is-for-fun-3"><a href="#Snapchat-lenses-is-for-fun-3" class="headerlink" title="Snapchat lenses is for fun"></a>Snapchat lenses is for fun</h4><p>The beauty of Snapchat lenses is that you can now create your own environment, which you can use each time you are taking photos or videos. Sure, you can always use the filters that are already available in the application, but not everyone would find those enough.</p><p>If you want some customization, or you just want to mess around until you get the filter that makes sense for you, Snapchat lenses are the way to go.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Lens-Studio.JPG"                      alt="lens studio"                ></p><h4 id="Lens-Studio-is-for-business-3"><a href="#Lens-Studio-is-for-business-3" class="headerlink" title="Lens Studio is for business"></a>Lens Studio is for business</h4><p>Lens Studio is perfect for businesses that may want to create unique environments for their clients, or the times when they are releasing company Snapchat posts. Say the company is hosting an event. They may want a custom graphic for that event, which is used for all the pictures and videos posted to Snapchat about the event. Using Lens Studio lets them do that with ease.</p><p>Create Your Own Lens is great when you are going to a special event, birthday party or graduating, and you want a special graphic that comes up in all your snaps. It is very intuitive to use, and is available through the App Store as a download.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/len-studio-snapchat.JPG"                      alt="lens studio snapchat"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Use-Lens-Studio-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Use-Lens-Studio-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Use Lens Studio"></a>Part 2: How to Use Lens Studio</h2><h4 id="1-Download-Lens-Studio-3"><a href="#1-Download-Lens-Studio-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Download Lens Studio"></a>1. Download Lens Studio</h4><p>The first step involves downloading Lens Studio, which you can do from your computer. It is compatible with both Windows and Mac computers, and will run on any semi-modern system. According to the Snapchat team, Lens Studio is similar to the program used by their AR teams to create lenses. That means you are getting similar functionality, but with an easier to manage interface.</p><h4 id="2-Choose-Templates-Page-3"><a href="#2-Choose-Templates-Page-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Choose Templates Page"></a>2. Choose Templates Page</h4><p>It is normal to feel a little overwhelmed the first time you try and use this program. But that is why the templates page is so great. You can select from templates depending on the type of lens that you are hoping to create. You can just use a template, or you can incorporate your own ideas to customize the template.</p><p>There is also a Lens Studio Overview guide that you can access online, which will help you get acquainted with the program’s various features and quirks.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lens-studio-templates.JPG"                      alt="lens studio templates"                ></p><h4 id="3-Use-Studio-Panels-3"><a href="#3-Use-Studio-Panels-3" class="headerlink" title="3.

This is the area where you can add your own 2D or 3D objects, and you can visualize how they would look as a Snapchat filter. You can add, remove, resize and drag objects to specific areas of the screen.</p><p>There are other tools accessible from the Resources panel. You can use these tools to ensure that your Snapchat lens is exactly as you want.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lens-studio-panal.JPG"                      alt="lens studio panel"                ></p><h4 id="4-Preview-the-Snapchat-Lens-You-Create-3"><a href="#4-Preview-the-Snapchat-Lens-You-Create-3" class="headerlink" title="4.

When you are satisfied with the image on the preview, you can pair your phone with the application, and you will be able to send that Snapchat lens onto your phone through your Snapcode. It is that simple!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/preview-snapchat.JPG"                      alt="preview lens studio"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Create-Snapchat-Lenses-Using-Create-Your-Own-Lens-3"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Create-Snapchat-Lenses-Using-Create-Your-Own-Lens-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Create Snapchat Lenses Using Create Your Own Lens"></a>Part 3: How to Create Snapchat Lenses Using Create Your Own Lens</h2><ol><li>There are two ways that you can access the tool for creating fun Snapchat lenses. You can either visit the website snapchat.com&#x2F;create, or you can go on the “filters and lenses” section on your iOS device. If you are using Snapchat on an Android device, you will only have the option for the website. But the feature is coming to the Android version of Snapchat very soon.</li><li>When you are in the application or on the website, you may start to look at the different templates for Snapchat lenses.

Featuring an anti-screenshot notification system that automatically notifies posters when a recipient or audience member screenshots a snap, it’s become increasingly harder to screenshot without being detected.</p><p>That being said, there are still plenty of other methods that offer a practical alternative to ensure you avoid that awkward automated notification.</p><h4 id="Option-1-Use-Another-Phone-or-Mobile-Device-to-Take-Snapchat-Screenshot"><a href="#Option-1-Use-Another-Phone-or-Mobile-Device-to-Take-Snapchat-Screenshot" class="headerlink" title="Option 1. Use Another Phone or Mobile Device to Take Snapchat Screenshot"></a>Option 1. Use Another Phone or Mobile Device to Take Snapchat Screenshot</h4><p>An easy and risk-free way to capture and store a specific snap with ease, utilizing another mobile device or camera is a great method that requires very little effort. Simply us a second phone, or a nearby tablet, to record the whole duration of the video or photo.</p><p>Although the quality of the recording won’t be as crisp and clear as it appears on the handheld, this is a reliable and fool-proof way to preserve those special snaps. From those video recordings, you should then be able to crop out the video or image you needed.</p><p>Missed it?</p><p>Why not take advantage of Snapchat’s “replay” mode to ensure you get the perfect shot – but be warned, posters also get notified of this too.</p><h4 id="Option-2-Use-the-Built-In-Screen-Recoding-Tool-on-iOS11"><a href="#Option-2-Use-the-Built-In-Screen-Recoding-Tool-on-iOS11" class="headerlink" title="Option 2. Use the Built-In Screen Recoding Tool on iOS11"></a>Option 2. Use the Built-In Screen Recoding Tool on iOS11</h4><p>If you didn’t already know, there’s a built-in screen recording software within iOS11 that allows you to effectively capture and record snaps with ease. Lying within the Settings of any iPhone, follow these easy steps on how to live record your screen:</p><ul><li>Step 1: Head to Settings &gt; Control Centre &gt; Customize Controls</li><li>Step 2: Locate the “Screen Recording” functionality</li><li>Step 3: Select the small cross to add it to your Control Centre</li><li>Step 4: To activate – Tap the icon with the 2 concentric circles to start recording. To complete a recording, simply tap the red bar that’s present at the top of the screen and select “End Recording”.</li></ul><p>Although it’s not possible to start recording a snap whilst it’s already open, it’s best to start recording before you opt to open a specific message.</p><p>Please note: If you have updated to Snapchat version 10.17.5, the posters will be notified each and every time you initiate and capture a recording through the use of this built-in recorder.</p><h4 id="Option-3-Use-QuickTime-Screen-Capture-on-a-Mac"><a href="#Option-3-Use-QuickTime-Screen-Capture-on-a-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Option 3. Use QuickTime Screen Capture on a Mac"></a>Option 3. Use QuickTime Screen Capture on a Mac</h4><p>A little more technical than simply using another mobile device to record a snap, using the QuickTime Player is an efficient and high-quality method for those looking to secretly store a snapchat post.</p><p>To start recording snaps, follow these simple steps:</p><ul><li>Step 1: Connect your iPhone to your Mac</li><li>Step 2: Open the QuickTime Player application</li><li>Step 3: Select <strong>File &gt; New Movie Recording</strong> from the menu</li><li>Step 4: Once loaded, simply hover the mouse beside the recording button. By clicking the small arrow, you’ll be provided with a range of different recording options</li><li>Step 5: Select your Phone as the <strong>Movie Recording Input</strong></li></ul><p>Once connected, your Mac screen should now be mirroring your mobile device. Just like you would on your phone, simply hit record and head on over to the Snapchat application to begin recording.</p><h4 id="Option-4-Use-the-Mirror-Feature-for-Android"><a href="#Option-4-Use-the-Mirror-Feature-for-Android" class="headerlink" title="Option 4. Use the Mirror Feature for Android"></a>Option 4. Use the Mirror Feature for Android</h4><p>Similar to the use of QuickTime or the iOS11 Screen Recording software, Screen Mirroring is another effective method for capturing Snapchat screenshots without the poster being made aware. By connecting a HDMI cable to both your TV and laptop, or by accessing the “Screen Mirroring” application that’s often built-in to most Smart Phones and Android devices, it’s possible to mirror&#x2F;cast the active screen on your device onto an external platform.</p><p>In doing so, you’re presented with the opportunity to utilize another device to record a playing snap or even share a recently received snap with other audience members that are present in the room.</p><h4 id="Option-5-Delay-the-Snapchat-Screenshot-Notification"><a href="#Option-5-Delay-the-Snapchat-Screenshot-Notification" class="headerlink" title="Option 5. Delay the Snapchat Screenshot Notification"></a>Option 5. Delay the Snapchat Screenshot Notification</h4><p>A method for those feeling a more confident or even for those that aren’t too bothered about their posters receiving a notification in the long run, this method is a great way to delay the arrival of that pop-down notification.</p><p>To delay the notification process, follow these simple steps:</p><ul><li>Step 1: Load the Snapchat application on your mobile device</li><li>Step 2: Find the snap you want to open&#x2F;record (ensure it is fully loaded)</li><li>Step 3: Turn off WiFi, Bluetooth, Mobile Data</li><li>Step 4: Turn on the Airplane Mode</li><li>Step 5: Open the snap and take your screenshot</li><li>Step 6: Wait approximately 30 seconds and then turn all your connections back on</li></ul><p>Designed to postpone the process of the poster receiving a notification, but not allowing for viewers to screenshot undetected, this method allows audience members to screenshot snaps from those that are perhaps a little unobservant when it comes to checking their notifications.</p><p>Be warned though, some posters may catch on to this method of screenshotting and they may stop sharing their videos and images with you.</p><h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>Despite there being plenty of reasons why there might be a need for you to record a Snapchat memory without the sender being made aware, it’s important to note that this can also be viewed as a breach of privacy with senders not only being informed of who has taken a screenshot, but also how many times they’ve done so and of which post.</p><p>With Snapchat designed to maintain the notion that any media sent between users is considered temporary, thanks to the 5-10 second duration limit, the methods listed above, although not fail-proof, are suggested as simple yet effective ways to avoid triggering an unwanted notification whilst using this highly popular social networking application.</p><p><a

The good news is that two new Snapchat tools have been released – the <strong>Lens Studio</strong> and Create Your Own Lens applications.</p><p>If you are a regular Snapchat user, you may want to learn about the Snapchat lens and how it can help you. We will help you get started. Here is our step by step guide on how to make Snapchat lenses.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1"><strong>Part1: Comparing Lens Studio and Creating Your Own Lens</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part2"><strong>Part2: How to Use Lens Studio</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part3"><strong>Part3: How to Create Snapchat Lenses Using Create Your Own Lens</strong></a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-Comparing-Lens-Studio-and-Creating-Your-Own-Lens"><a href="#Part-1-Comparing-Lens-Studio-and-Creating-Your-Own-Lens" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Comparing Lens Studio and Creating Your Own Lens"></a>Part 1: Comparing Lens Studio and Creating Your Own Lens</h2><p>The two programs that we are highlighting today are Lens Studio and Create Your Own Lens. These are both fantastic programs for creating your own Snapchat lens, but they do have slightly different uses. If you are the type of person who wants to design a professional Snapchat lens, you are going to prefer Lens Studio.</p><p>But if you are hoping to come up with something creative that you can share with your friends and family, then you may love Create Your Own Lens. It is a very easy program to use, and it offers a ton of features that you may be surprised to see.</p><h4 id="Snapchat-lenses-is-for-fun"><a href="#Snapchat-lenses-is-for-fun" class="headerlink" title="Snapchat lenses is for fun"></a>Snapchat lenses is for fun</h4><p>The beauty of Snapchat lenses is that you can now create your own environment, which you can use each time you are taking photos or videos. Sure, you can always use the filters that are already available in the application, but not everyone would find those enough.</p><p>If you want some customization, or you just want to mess around until you get the filter that makes sense for you, Snapchat lenses are the way to go.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Lens-Studio.JPG"                      alt="lens studio"                ></p><h4 id="Lens-Studio-is-for-business"><a href="#Lens-Studio-is-for-business" class="headerlink" title="Lens Studio is for business"></a>Lens Studio is for business</h4><p>Lens Studio is perfect for businesses that may want to create unique environments for their clients, or the times when they are releasing company Snapchat posts. Say the company is hosting an event. They may want a custom graphic for that event, which is used for all the pictures and videos posted to Snapchat about the event. Using Lens Studio lets them do that with ease.</p><p>Create Your Own Lens is great when you are going to a special event, birthday party or graduating, and you want a special graphic that comes up in all your snaps. It is very intuitive to use, and is available through the App Store as a download.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/len-studio-snapchat.JPG"                      alt="lens studio snapchat"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Use-Lens-Studio"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Use-Lens-Studio" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Use Lens Studio"></a>Part 2: How to Use Lens Studio</h2><h4 id="1-Download-Lens-Studio"><a href="#1-Download-Lens-Studio" class="headerlink" title="1. Download Lens Studio"></a>1. Download Lens Studio</h4><p>The first step involves downloading Lens Studio, which you can do from your computer. It is compatible with both Windows and Mac computers, and will run on any semi-modern system. According to the Snapchat team, Lens Studio is similar to the program used by their AR teams to create lenses. That means you are getting similar functionality, but with an easier to manage interface.</p><h4 id="2-Choose-Templates-Page"><a href="#2-Choose-Templates-Page" class="headerlink" title="2. Choose Templates Page"></a>2. Choose Templates Page</h4><p>It is normal to feel a little overwhelmed the first time you try and use this program. But that is why the templates page is so great. You can select from templates depending on the type of lens that you are hoping to create. You can just use a template, or you can incorporate your own ideas to customize the template.</p><p>There is also a Lens Studio Overview guide that you can access online, which will help you get acquainted with the program’s various features and quirks.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lens-studio-templates.JPG"                      alt="lens studio templates"                ></p><h4 id="3-Use-Studio-Panels"><a href="#3-Use-Studio-Panels" class="headerlink" title="3. Use Studio Panels"></a>3. Use Studio Panels</h4><p>Are you ready to create your own custom Snapchat lens? It is time to head over to Studio Panels on the application. This is the area where you can add your own 2D or 3D objects, and you can visualize how they would look as a Snapchat filter. You can add, remove, resize and drag objects to specific areas of the screen.</p><p>There are other tools accessible from the Resources panel. You can use these tools to ensure that your Snapchat lens is exactly as you want.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lens-studio-panal.JPG"                      alt="lens studio panel"                ></p><h4 id="4-Preview-the-Snapchat-Lens-You-Create"><a href="#4-Preview-the-Snapchat-Lens-You-Create" class="headerlink" title="4. Preview the Snapchat Lens You Create"></a>4. Preview the Snapchat Lens You Create</h4><p>The great thing about this application is that you can preview the lens before you send it out to your phone. When you are satisfied with the image on the preview, you can pair your phone with the application, and you will be able to send that Snapchat lens onto your phone through your Snapcode. It is that simple!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/preview-snapchat.JPG"                      alt="preview lens studio"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Create-Snapchat-Lenses-Using-Create-Your-Own-Lens"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Create-Snapchat-Lenses-Using-Create-Your-Own-Lens" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Create Snapchat Lenses Using Create Your Own Lens"></a>Part 3: How to Create Snapchat Lenses Using Create Your Own Lens</h2><ol><li>There are two ways that you can access the tool for creating fun Snapchat lenses. You can either visit the website snapchat.com&#x2F;create, or you can go on the “filters and lenses” section on your iOS device. If you are using Snapchat on an Android device, you will only have the option for the website. But the feature is coming to the Android version of Snapchat very soon.</li><li>When you are in the application or on the website, you may start to look at the different templates for Snapchat lenses. Now you can add other items into the templates, such as photographs, text or graphics.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-snapchat.JPG"                      alt="create snapchat"                ></p><p>It is all up to your imagination. You can create the perfect Snapchat lens, which you can then send into your Snapchat account through your Snapcode. Of course, if you are using your iOS device to create the lens, it is already linked to your account.</p><p>Another cool feature is how you can set the location for where the Snapchat lens is available. Say you are hosting a party. You can have the Snapchat lens available to everyone who uses Snapchat within a set square footage of your home. That is an amazing way to let everyone share social media pictures and photos of your party, through the lens you created.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Creating Snapchat lenses has never been easier. Whether you are a business looking to add a custom lens, or you just want to create a fun lens for a graduation or party, there are tools that make the job very easy. Using these tools will allow you to create the perfect Snapchat lens for any occasion.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Ollie Mattison</p><p>Ollie Mattison is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Ollie Mattison</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-how-to-add-music-to-any-snapchat-video-in-2024/"><u>[Updated] How to Add Music to Any Snapchat Video, In 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-unleash-creativity-best-snap-ideas-of-the-year/"><u>[New] In 2024, Unleash Creativity  Best Snap Ideas of the Year</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-the-dynamic-world-of-digital-gifts-a-complete-guide-to-snapchat-gifs/"><u>[Updated] The Dynamic World of Digital Gifts  A Complete Guide to Snapchat Gifs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/new-mastering-snapchat-photo-edits-a-step-by-step-guide/"><u>[New] Mastering Snapchat Photo Edits  A Step-by-Step Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-make-every-snap-spectacited-top-editors-for-snapchats-best-effects/"><u>2024 Approved  Make Every Snap Spectacited  Top Editors for Snapchat's Best Effects</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-snapchat-integration-for-the-tech-savvy-mac-user-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Snapchat Integration for the Tech-Savvy Mac User for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-unveiling-concealed-intentions-the-art-of-snapchat-emojis-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Unveiling Concealed Intentions  The Art of Snapchat Emojis for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-becoming-a-snapchat-illustration-wizard/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Becoming a Snapchat Illustration Wizard</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-is-my-friends-account-invisible-potential-block/"><u>In 2024, Is My Friend's Account Invisible?

The service has launched several innovative features over the years and one of their latest and popular tools is cameos. It is a fun way that one can express themselves, with their own faces plastered on comic characters or on bodies of animals and so forth.</p><ol><li><strong>What is a Snapchat Cameo?</strong></li></ol><p>If you have been seeing your friends add their faces to fun emojis, cartoons, and other figures, you could do that too with this fun feature on Snapchat. A cameo is an option that allows you to add your face to comic characters or animals or even create funny videos with them. You become a star of looping, short videos that you can send across to your friends. It is a great way to express your emotions in moments. Instead of messages, <strong>Snapchat cameos</strong> are an innovative way to say hello, express your feelings, and so forth. It is possible to customize captions and add them to the cameos that you create.</p><p>These are easy to add and send in chat messages since it is an option that occurs next to the stickers. It is available on the apps created for Android and iOS devices. You can choose from more than 150 cameos which makes it a great feature.</p><p>Indeed, who would not want to have cool means to express themselves, their opinions, or tell their close friends what they feel? Snapchat offers several unique ways of expressing yourself. While you could attach videos or memes that express what you feel, with a cameo you can make that even more personalized and unique. Add your face to cool videos, animations, or pics. What’s more, you can add text in different fonts and with interesting effects. It is nothing short of creating a video by yourself. That too can be easily done in a matter of seconds, while you are on chat with your friends or loved ones.</p><ol><li><strong>How to Use Snapchat Cameo?</strong></li></ol><p>There are easy ways to get started when using <strong>Snapchat cameos</strong>. All you need is to tap on the button provided, on the sticker bar. It involves taking a selfie or choosing a picture or a video that you already have on your phone or tablet. If a friend has set up the feature in their Snapchat and is chatting live, it is possible to co-star in it together.</p><p>Here are simple ways to get started:</p><ul><li>Start by choosing a contact on the Snap list with whom you wish to start a conversation or want to send a pic or video using this feature. You will find the functionality while you are texting and adding effects to the conversation. For this reason, the function appears in the borders of the keyboard you use.</li><li>Once the chat page opens up, find the face icon next to the chat bar which shows above the keyboard. This leads to the emoji page along where you will find the <strong>Snapchat cameos</strong> option at the bottom.</li><li>You will find the cameo icon at the bottom of this section. It looks like a face with a + sign on it. This will lead you to create the cameo video or pic.</li><li>It starts by activating the selfie camera. It aligns the face on the camera with an outline in blue. It will instruct you to take the selfie picture.</li><li>You will then get options for adding filters to the cameo of your face. This can consist of pictures you have in your gallery or a repository of images and cartoons that the app provides. You could also source images from the internet or videos to use for this purpose.</li><li>Once the filters are applied and captions added, you are ready to send across the cameo to your selected contact. The <strong>Snapchat cameos</strong> you create get added to the chat option directly.</li><li>It is also possible to create a two-person cameo, especially if the person’s pics are available on your gallery of images. You can also add text to make the pics more expressive.</li></ul><ol><li><strong>How to Fix Snapchat Cameo Not Showing up?</strong></li></ol><p>Users of the Snapchat app can use cameo as one of the innovative new features that help them add their faces to funny videos, cartoons, and so forth. However, in certain instances, the cameos might not show up. In such cases you can fix such issues with the following steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Update App</strong></li></ul><p>This is a solution that might prove effective. You could opt for updating the app by downloading the latest version of the app from the Apple or Android app store. Once the app updates and installs, you might find that the issue is resolved. One could also use the beta version of the app available at online stores.</p><ul><li><strong>Check Settings on the Phone</strong></li></ul><p>This is another possible way to get the issue resolved. Visit the phone settings. Opt for the section on app management. Here search for the Snapchat app. Here you could opt to uninstall and use Force Stop. Visit storage options and clear all data. You can then restart your phone. Once you open the app you could find the cameo issue resolved.</p><ul><li><strong>Install VPN</strong></li></ul><p>There could be instances when the feature does not show up in the app due to the restrictions that countries impose. Users can install VPN in such an instance. This will then help resolve the issue. One could then reinstall the app and find the feature available on the app.</p><p>One of the above resolutions usually proves effective if you are unable to find <strong>Snapchat cameos</strong> on your app. If your phone or tablet is of an older version that does not support the app or you are using a simulator platform, you might not find this update in the version you use.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Here we understand what is the <strong>Snapchat cameos</strong> feature that one can find and how to use it. It is one of the new features that the social media service has introduced. It helps animate photos and videos with a selfie of the user. The photos and videos that the user creates with this feature can be easily shared with the contacts of the user. It is a feature that is easy to use on the app. One can get started by using their faces on the latest memes that they find on the internet. Here we also discuss the different ways one can resolve problems that arise when this feature does not show up on the app.</p><p>So go ahead and be creative with your expressions. You can add a light note to your messages, create funny pics and videos and bring about a comic look and feel to a conversation. It is also a great way to express how you feel without having to be serious about it. This is especially useful if you wish to let someone know how you feel but you are unsure of what their reactions would be.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AIMmjowaFs4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/Y5UmwDaI7HU/s250-c-k/photo.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Liza Brown</p><p>Liza Brown is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Liza Brown</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-deciphering-the-covert-codes-of-snapchats-emojis/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Deciphering the Covert Codes of Snapchat's Emojis</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-snapshot-superstars-essential-filters-to-elevate-your-snaps/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Snapshot Superstars  Essential Filters to Elevate Your Snaps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/the-secrets-to-never-ending-snaps-on-snapchat-for-2024/"><u>The Secrets to Never-Ending Snaps on Snapchat for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/deciphering-the-lack-of-contacts-and-snaps-on-snapchat-for-2024/"><u>Deciphering the Lack of Contacts and Snaps on Snapchat for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-from-snapper-to-maker-wealth-creation-on-snapchat-platforms/"><u>[New] In 2024, From Snapper to Maker  Wealth Creation on Snapchat Platforms</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/new-essential-tips-for-storing-snapchat-videos-on-devices-for-2024/"><u>[New] Essential Tips for Storing Snapchat Videos on Devices for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-snapchat-private-chronicles-top-120plus-innovative-ideas-to-distinguish-you/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Snapchat Private Chronicles  Top 120+ Innovative Ideas to Distinguish You</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-quick-fix-getting-snapchat-installed-on-mac/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Quick Fix  Getting Snapchat Installed on Mac</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/new-master-the-art-of-live-streaming-snapchat-videos-for-2024/"><u>[New] Master the Art of Live Streaming Snapchat Videos for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/updated-understanding-key-aspects-of-gif-animation/"><u>[Updated] Understanding Key Aspects of GIF Animation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-optimizing.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-top-rated-free-online-libraries-for-guitarists-high-quality-melodies-and-visuals/"><u>New In 2024, Top-Rated FREE Online Libraries for Guitarists High-Quality Melodies & Visuals</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-mov-files-saving-methods-for-windows-10-users/"><u>[New] In 2024, .mov Files  Saving Methods for Windows 10 Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-dividing-recordings-top-cam-scrutiny-review/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Dividing Recordings  Top Cam Scrutiny Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/6-proven-ways-to-unlock-nokia-c12-phone-when-you-forget-the-password-by-drfone-android/"><u>6 Proven Ways to Unlock Nokia C12 Phone When You Forget the Password</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/tackling-muted-frames-on-snapchat-videos-the-ultimate-solution-for-2024/"><u>Tackling Muted Frames on Snapchat Videos - The Ultimate Solution for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-tips.techidaily.com/updated-the-resonance-of-rhythm-music-that-echoes-films/"><u>[Updated] The Resonance of Rhythm  Music That Echoes Films</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/use-device-manager-to-identify-malfunctioning-your-drivers-with-windows-device-manager-on-windows-11-and-10-and-7-by-drivereasy-guide/"><u>Use Device Manager to identify malfunctioning your drivers with Windows Device Manager on Windows 11 & 10 & 7</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-editing.techidaily.com/1713962758344-updated-do-you-want-your-photos-and-videos-to-give-an-old-and-vintage-feel-here-are-some-vintage-luts-premiere-pro-free-and-paid-options-available-to-downlo/"><u>Updated Do You Want Your Photos and Videos to Give an Old and Vintage Feel?

Snapchat Overview"></a>Part 1. Snapchat Overview</h2><p>There is a saying goes: <em>Know the weather, know the terrain, and your victory will be complete.</em> Before we look into the detailed guidance in <a href="#_Methods_To_Make">Part 2</a>, we should know more about Snapchat.</p><p>Snapchat is a photo messaging app developed on September 16, 2011, by Bobby Murphy,Reggie Brown, and Evan Spiegel while they were studying at Stanford University.</p><p>With Snapchat, you can take photos, record videos, add text and drawings, and send them to a controlled list of recipients. These sent MMS are known as “Snaps,” and you can set a time limit on how long recipients can view them (a maximum of 24 hours, after which they will be automatically deleted).</p><p>Since its inception, Snapchat has evolved to include a wider range of features, including live video chat, story sharing, and lenses (augmented reality filters). Each of these functions is discussed below in detail:</p><ul><li><strong>Chat:</strong> A messaging functionality you can use to communicate with your friends and family, share snaps, send stickers, or make a video&#x2F;audio call.</li><li><strong>Stories:</strong> With this feature, you can add a compilation of images or videos for public viewing - available for 24 hours and then automatically disappear.</li><li><strong>Live Stories:</strong> There are stories of other users from a specific location or event that disappear after 24 hours.</li><li><strong>Lenses:</strong> These AR filters can be used to add fun effects to your pictures and post them as your stories or send them to someone.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/snapchat-lens.jpg"                      alt="snapchat lens"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Filters:</strong> Unlike lenses, they are static photo <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >overlays&#x2F;effects <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that you can apply to your pictures to make them more captivating.</li><li><strong>Snap Map:</strong> This functionality lets you share your location with your friends. On the map, you will appear as a Bitmoji for them.</li><li><strong>Snapchat Spotlight:</strong> This is a TikTok-like feature helping many Snapchat users to make money. You can submit your best videos with a chance of earning a share of up to $1 million&#x2F;day, depending on the number of views.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Methods-To-Make-Money-On-Snapchat"><a href="#Part-2-Methods-To-Make-Money-On-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Methods To Make Money On Snapchat"></a>Part 2. Methods To Make Money On Snapchat</h2><p>Snapchat’s focus on short, time-limited content (your snaps&#x2F;stories stay only for 24 hours) encourages more personalized sharing and contrasts more substantial relationships between brands and customers.</p><p>So, how to make money on Snapchat?</p><p>Keep reading to find out!</p><h3 id="Method-1-Creating-Viral-Video"><a href="#Method-1-Creating-Viral-Video" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Creating Viral Video"></a>Method 1: Creating Viral Video</h3><p>When you submit your videos to Spotlight, Snapchat uses an algorithm to personalize the content to its viewers based on their interests by looking at factors such as how many times they watch a video, the number of skips, shares, and likes.</p><p>Thus, if your videos get more viewers and become viral, you will start earning money real quick. With that being said, let’s understand with a report to see how you can begin making millions with your viral videos on Snapchat.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://biographydaily.com/2022/07/27/cam-casey/" >Cam Casey <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, 19 years old TikTok star, decided to post his science experiment involving the explosion of a Coca-Cola bottle on Snapchat. His video went viral on Spotlight, and within two weeks, he became the top performer and earned hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p><p>Here is one example video about an experiment of Coke bottle:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXs0a7BoWxs" >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXs0a7BoWxs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Casey is just one example of how Snapchat’s new feature is helping people earn money, and you can be a part of it, too, by following some simple guidelines for posting Snapchat videos. A few of these suggestions are:</p><ul><li>Post up to 60 seconds long videos.</li><li>Add at least one hashtag.</li><li>Make content that is appropriate for a 30+ audience.</li><li>Avoid <a class="link"   href="https://support.snapchat.com/en-US/a/spotlight-guidelines" >forbidden content <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</li><li>Do not use sponsored or promotional content.</li></ul><p>You might be thinking, “how can you edit your videos to enhance them and make them go viral?”</p><p>Well, you can use <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> - a user-friendly mobile editor that can help you with all your editing tasks on the go.

However, for this method, you must have a solid follower base to be an <a class="link"   href="https://influencermarketinghub.com/what-is-an-influencer/" >influencer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for any brand out there.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/influencer-marketing-on-snapchat.jpg"                      alt="influencer marketing on snapchat"                ></p><p><strong>Create Snapchat Ads For Businesses</strong></p><p>Ads are one of the commercial modes of Snapchat. While most business owners are unaware of Snapchat or how to use it to promote their products and services, you can grab this opportunity to earn more.</p><p>With creative and interactive ads, you can catch users’ attention and advertise other businesses to earn some extra cash in a short time.</p><p>Some ads formats offered by Snapchats are:</p><ul><li>Story ads (a series of ads).</li><li>Collection ads (a series of products).</li><li>Filters (artistic overlays).</li><li>Commercials (up to three minutes long).</li><li>Single image or video ads.</li><li>Lenses (interaction with augmented reality).</li></ul><p>Besides creating ads, you can also help businesses create AR filters and stickers to attract the masses. For instance, Sephora created an AR game lens to advertise their make-up products, as can be seen in the video:</p><p>Similarly, Domino’s created a non-skippable ad campaign, “New Bigger Better,” in Europe and reached more than 800,000 Norwegian Snapchat users.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/dominos-snapchat-ad.jpg"                      alt="dominos snapchat ad"                ></p><h3 id="Method-3-Promote-Your-Own-Products-Or-Services-To-Increase-Sales"><a href="#Method-3-Promote-Your-Own-Products-Or-Services-To-Increase-Sales" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Promote Your Own Products Or Services To Increase Sales"></a>Method 3: Promote Your Own Products Or Services To Increase Sales</h3><p>Aside from promoting other businesses, you can also promote your own products and services on Snapchat. You can share a clickable link or a downloadable asset of your product or service with your followers and friends.</p><p>One limitation here is that you must have a larger number of Snapchat friends to generate the desired revenue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"                                     ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Avoid being too commercial. The audience’s feeling is the most important thing to consider here.</p><h3 id="Method-4-Refer-Other-Products-Affiliate-Marketing"><a href="#Method-4-Refer-Other-Products-Affiliate-Marketing" class="headerlink" title="Method 4: Refer Other Products (Affiliate Marketing)"></a>Method 4: Refer Other Products (Affiliate Marketing)</h3><p>While Snapchat provides influencers with an opportunity to create sponsored content that showcases a brand or product to their followers, you can also use affiliate marketing, in which you receive a commission for promoting someone else’s products or services using a link or promo code.</p><p>Try to create content that is creative, engaging, and captivating for affiliate marketing. This will definitely help you get user attention and generate more money via your provided links.</p><p>If you want to know more about Snapchat Affiliate, please read <em>The Ultimate Snapchat Marketing Strategy That Converts</em></p><h3 id="Method-5-Utilize-Geofilter"><a href="#Method-5-Utilize-Geofilter" class="headerlink" title="Method 5. Utilize Geofilter"></a>Method 5. Utilize Geofilter</h3><p>Geofilters are a fun way to add creative flair to your snaps! These filters can be customized with personalized messages or designs for a specific event, new store openings, or grabbing users’ attention and are available only at specific locations.</p><p>There are two types of Geofilers:</p><ul><li><strong>On-demand Geofilters:</strong> These are paid ad filters created by businesses. For instance, Starbucks used a fall-themed geofilter for users near a Starbucks.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/geo-filter-by-starbucks.jpg"                      alt="geo filter by starbucks"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Community Geofilters:</strong> These are free-to-create filters that must be approved by Snapchat and can be created for special events or landmarks.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/geo-filter-when-visitinf-grand-canyon.jpg"                      alt="geo filter when visitinf grand canyon"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"                                     ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Make sure the location is intriguing to users while establishing a Geofilter.</p><h3 id="Method-6-Use-Sponsored-Lenses"><a href="#Method-6-Use-Sponsored-Lenses" class="headerlink" title="Method 6: Use Sponsored Lenses"></a>Method 6: Use Sponsored Lenses</h3><p>Sponsored lenses are AR filters you can create on Snapchat to promote your business by sharing them with your targeted audience.</p><p>When you produce a campaign using sponsored lenses, the platform will guarantee that certain users will use the lens, resulting in huge revenue in return.</p><p>For instance, to accelerate their app’s user growth, UK’s famous Starling bank used an AR lens in 2019 to grab the viewer’s attention. As a result, they received a 61% lower cost-per-install than their other campaign.</p><p>Similarly, BACARDÍ produced a lens with the summer theme to enhance their brand awareness and drive more sales. In their ten days campaign, they reached over 2.5 M Snapchatters and increased the purchase intent of BACARDÍ products.</p><h3 id="Method-7-Get-Featured-On-The-Snapchat-Spotlight"><a href="#Method-7-Get-Featured-On-The-Snapchat-Spotlight" class="headerlink" title="Method 7. Get Featured On The Snapchat Spotlight"></a>Method 7. Get Featured On The Snapchat Spotlight</h3><p>Snapchat Spotlight is a new feature highlighting the best content from Snapchat creators. Every day, the platform curates a selection of videos from creators worldwide and puts them in the Spotlight for the viewers.</p><p>If you can create awesome content, this will help you expand your exposure instead of generating profits directly. To use the Spotlight, create a snap, add music or voiceover, and click the <strong>“Send &gt;Spotlight”</strong> option.</p><h3 id="Method-8-Use-Story-Ads"><a href="#Method-8-Use-Story-Ads" class="headerlink" title="Method 8: Use Story Ads"></a>Method 8: Use Story Ads</h3><p>Story Ads let you expand your following base, increase your brand awareness, and get more customers around the globe by displaying ads in the Discovery feed on Snapchat.

Ideas To Create And Send Snaps Quickly</h3><p>Below are some tips&#x2F;ideas to help you quickly create and send Snaps to keep your Snapchat streak alive:</p><p><strong>Idea 1. Edit Blank Snap And Send As New Snap</strong></p><p>If you have run out of snap ideas, don’t worry about sending a high-quality one. No one is judging you, so send a blank snap to keep the streak alive; however, edit it a little so it looks like you have put in some effort.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/sending-a-blank-screen-to-keep-streak-alive.jpg"                      alt="sending a blank screen to keep streak alive"                ></p><p><strong>Idea 2. Send Black Screen</strong></p><p>Your Snapstreaks are about to expire, and you’re freaking out? Here’s a little hack that will keep them alive: send a black screen snap. That’s right! You can also add some doodles or stickers to the picture to make things look more interesting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/sending-blank-screen-as-snap.jpg"                      alt="sending blank screen as snap"                ></p><p><strong>Idea 3. Use Emojis And Bitmojis</strong></p><p>You can also add emojis or Bitmojis to your photos to make them look more interesting and fun. Simply open up the Snapchat app, click a picture, and tap on the emoji icon to select the emoji or Bitmoji that you want to add to your Snap. You can even resize and move them around to get it just right.</p><p><strong>Idea 4. Snap With Your Pets</strong></p><p>We all love our pets - and we also like staying connected with our friends on Snapchat. So why not combine the two? Occasionally take a picture of your pet using the app and send it to your besties to make their day and keep the streak alive!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/snap-with-pet-to-maintain-streak.jpg"                      alt="snap with pet to maintain streak"                ></p><p><strong>Idea 5. Streak With Daily Food</strong></p><p>Food is always a good topic and can be one of the best ways to keep your Snapchat streak alive. Simply send a snap to your friend every day before you start munching.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/streak-daily-food.jpg"                      alt="streak daily food"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-2-Seize-Occasions-And-Keep-Your-Snapchat-Sneak-Alive"><a href="#Tip-2-Seize-Occasions-And-Keep-Your-Snapchat-Sneak-Alive" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2.

Seize Occasions And Keep Your Snapchat Sneak Alive</h3><p>To keep your Snapchat streak alive, try to seize any opportunity you can to take pictures and send them to friends. Below are some ideas to do this:</p><p><strong>Idea 1. The First Day Matters</strong></p><p>Many people choose to start their streaks on special days because it helps them remember to keep them alive. For example, if you start your streak on your birthday, you’ll always remember to keep the streak going on, and it will also help you to grab the attention of people.</p><p><strong>Idea 2. Memorable Day</strong></p><p>We all have memorable days in our lives, like a milestone, graduation, or special event that we want to remember forever.

Streak While Traveling</strong></p><p>Whenever you are on a trip, travel to your office&#x2F;college, or head out to run some errands, remember to take a picture of the surroundings that look interesting and send it to whom you are establishing the streak.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/send-snapstreak-while-traveling.jpg"                      alt="send snapstreak while traveling"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-3-Organize-Your-Snapchat-And-Your-Time"><a href="#Tip-3-Organize-Your-Snapchat-And-Your-Time" class="headerlink" title="Tip 3.

Below we’ve provided some ideas to help you organize your time and your snaps.</p><p><strong>Idea 1. Edit the Name of your Snapchat Friends</strong></p><p>To avoid losing your Snapchat streaks with any of your contacts, you should start editing their names. Snapchat lists your most contacted friends at the top, so you might not see the others who are lower on your list. Editing their names to include something that will help you search for them will make it easier to avoid forgetting to send them a snap regularly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/edit-the-name-of-your-snapchat-friend.jpg"                      alt="edit the name of your snapchat friend"                ></p><p><strong>Idea 2. Pin Your Conversations</strong></p><p>If you want to keep someone at the top of your chat list, consider pinning their chat. This will also ultimately help you send snaps to them without breaking the streak.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/pin-conversation-in-snapchat.jpg"                      alt="pin conversation in snapchat"                ></p><p><strong>Idea 3.

Though, to rival other apps like Instagram and TikTok, Snapchat has recently added a “Sound” feature. With this newly-added option, users can add music to a Snapchat video pretty easily and make their snaps more interesting. In this post, I’m going to let you know how to add music to a Snapchat video without any hassle. Let’s get it started and level-up your Snapchat game!</p><h2 id="Part-1-What’s-the-Sound-Feature-in-Snapchat"><a href="#Part-1-What’s-the-Sound-Feature-in-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What’s the Sound Feature in Snapchat?"></a>Part 1: What’s the Sound Feature in Snapchat?</h2><p>Before we learn how to add music to your Snapchat video, let’s quickly get to know about the “Sounds” feature of the app. If you have been using Instagram or TikTok, then you might be familiar with their music feature.</p><p>Similarly, in 2020, Snapchat has also included a Sound feature that lets us add music to our snaps (photos or videos). For this, you can integrate Snapchat with a streaming service like Spotify, Pandora, Apple Music, or Soundcloud. While it doesn’t include all sorts of tracks, you can find most of the popular songs so that you can easily add music to a Snapchat video and make it interesting.</p><p>Once the other person would view your snap, they can hear the music playing in the background. If they want to listen to it or know more about the song, then they can just tap on its sticker on your snap.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Add-Music-to-a-Snapchat-Video-on-iPhone-or-Android"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Add-Music-to-a-Snapchat-Video-on-iPhone-or-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Add Music to a Snapchat Video on iPhone or Android?"></a>Part 2: How to Add Music to a Snapchat Video on iPhone or Android?</h2><p>One of the best things about Snapchat is that the overall interface of the app is pretty similar for both iOS and Android versions. Therefore, to learn how to add music on a Snapchat video, you need to follow the same process. As of now, you can find almost all the popular songs on Snapchat and can even record your own sounds.</p><p>To learn how to add music to your Snapchat video on your Android or iOS device, you can just follow this simple drill.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Visit the Snapchat Sound section on the app</strong></p><p>At first, just launch the Snapchat application on your device and tap on the camera icon from the home to start recording.</p><p>Using the rear or front camera of your device, you can now record any video on Snapchat. Once the video is recorded, you can tap on the music icon from the sidebar to add a song to a Snapchat video.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Search for any music to include in your Snaps</strong></p><p>As you would tap on the <strong>Music</strong> icon, you can view a list of various songs supported by Snapchat. If you want to look for anything specific, then just tap on the search icon and enter keywords to find a song of your choice.</p><p>Afterward, Snapchat will list the searched results, and you can tap on the play icon to first listen to the song. Just tap on the icon of the song and click on the “Next” button from the bottom to include it in the snap.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Trim and add the song to your Snapchat video</strong></p><p>Now, Snapchat will automatically display the snippet of the music at the bottom. You can use the left or the right slider option to trim the section of the music you want to add. Here, you also can tap on the play icon to listen to the track first.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Add music to your Snapchat video after recording</strong></p><p>That’s it! Once you have trimmed the music snippet, you can post it. You can tap on the shutter or the download icon first to save the video on your phone.</p><p>Now, you can preview the music via its sticker. You can just tap on the music sticker to change its appearance or drag it on the screen to place it anywhere you like. To change its size, you can just pinch-in or pinch-out the sticker.</p><p>In the end, just tap on the send icon to post your snap. You can add it to your story or sent it to any Snapchat contact. When they would open it, they can listen to the added song and even tap on the sticker to load it.</p><p>In this way, anyone can learn how to put music on a Snapchat video without any hassle.</p><h2 id="Part-3-FAQs-on-Adding-Music-to-a-Snapchat-Video"><a href="#Part-3-FAQs-on-Adding-Music-to-a-Snapchat-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: FAQs on Adding Music to a Snapchat Video"></a>Part 3: FAQs on Adding Music to a Snapchat Video</h2><p>Now when you know how to add music to your Snapchat video, let’s clear some common doubts related to it.</p><ul><li><strong>How to add your own music to a Snapchat video?</strong></li></ul><p>Apart from the available songs on Snapchat, the app also lets us add the sound of our choice. For this, just click on the music icon and tap the “Create Sound” button instead. This will let you record anything or create your own music on Snapchat.</p><ul><li><strong>Why are some songs not available on Snapchat?</strong></li></ul><p>The Sound feature of Snapchat only provides licensed music by collaborating with some of the biggest record labels. Therefore, while you can find most of the popular songs, chances are that some of them might be missing from the collection.</p><ul><li><strong>Why can’t I add music to my Snapchat videos?</strong></li></ul><p>Well, there could be two possible reasons for this – you might be using an old version of Snapchat or the feature might not be available in your region yet. To fix this, you can just go to the Snapchat page on the App&#x2F;Play Store and tap on the “Update” button. Furthermore, if the Sound feature has not been rolled out to your region, then you can just wait for a while.</p><p>As you can see, it is pretty easy to learn how to add music to a Snapchat video like a pro. With the newly-added Sounds feature, it is pretty easy to add a song to your Snapchat videos and make them more interesting. Go ahead and try this feature to make your snaps creative and share this guide with others to teach them how do you add music to a Snapchat video as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Ollie Mattison</p><p>Ollie Mattison is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Ollie Mattison</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-embrace-your-inner-cartoon-how-to-apply-snapchats-anime-effect/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Embrace Your Inner Cartoon  How To Apply Snapchat's Anime Effect</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-mastering-gifs-a-step-by-step-snapchat-guide/"><u>[Updated] Mastering GIFs  A Step-by-Step Snapchat Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/rapid-restoration-snapped-shenanigans-for-2024/"><u>Rapid Restoration  Snapped Shenanigans for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-securing-snapchat-footage-essential-mobile-tips/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Securing Snapchat Footage  Essential Mobile Tips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/stepwise-instructions-preserve-your-memories-by-uploading-to-snapchat-for-2024/"><u>Stepwise Instructions  Preserve Your Memories by Uploading to Snapchat for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/youtube-celebs-gabbing-via-snapchat-for-2024/"><u>YouTube Celebs Gabbing via Snapchat for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-snapchats-creative-frontier-mastering-more-than-120-stories-with-individual-flair/"><u>[New] In 2024, Snapchat's Creative Frontier  Mastering More than 120 Stories with Individual Flair</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-social-snippets-showcase-twitters-trending-threads/"><u>2024 Approved  Social Snippets Showcase  Twitter’s Trending Threads</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/the-hidden-economics-of-youtube-content-production/"><u>The Hidden Economics of YouTube Content Production</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/navigating-youtube-shorts-how-to-for-content-makers/"><u>Navigating YouTube Shorts  How-To for Content Makers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-ai-editor.techidaily.com/split-and-trim-mkv-files-best-free-tools-for-2024/"><u>Split and Trim MKV Files Best Free Tools for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-mastering-batch-background-erasure-in-affinity-photo/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Mastering Batch Background Erasure in Affinity Photo</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/new-improve-instagram-video-loading-times-effectively-for-2024/"><u>[New] Improve Instagram Video Loading Times Effectively for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-5-hassle-free-solutions-to-fake-location-on-find-my-friends-of-apple-iphone-15-pro-max-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, 5 Hassle-Free Solutions to Fake Location on Find My Friends Of Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/new-captivating-clips-keywords-that-ignite-viral-shorts-on-youtube-for-2024/"><u>[New] Captivating Clips  Keywords That Ignite Viral Shorts on YouTube for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-ultimate-shoppers-list-select-box-personalization-sites/"><u>[Updated] Ultimate Shopper's List  Select Box Personalization Sites</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

With more than 240 million active daily users, Snapchat is one of the most popular social media networks globally. It is also an instant messaging app that allows its users to express themselves visually in a diverse variety of manners including photos, videos, stories, stickers, emoji, and more.</p><p>One of the best features of Snapchat that makes it so attractive among the young audience is its mobile-oriented user interface. Snapchat was the first social networking platform to introduce the concept of daily stories which was widely adopted by other instant messengers as well including Instagram and WhatsApp. Since it is a mobile-oriented platform, you need to create and edit your videos in a certain way to make sure they are the best fit for Snapchat.</p><p>You May Also Like: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >The Ultimate Guide of Snapchat Filters <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="What-Are-the-Ideal-Features-of-a-Snapchat-Video"><a href="#What-Are-the-Ideal-Features-of-a-Snapchat-Video" class="headerlink" title="What Are the Ideal Features of a Snapchat Video?"></a>What Are the Ideal Features of a Snapchat Video?</h2><p>Snapchat is highly optimized for vertical viewing which means that all the content needs to be served in portrait aspect ratio instead of landscape used by YouTube and other video platforms.

This resolution will ensure that your video loads in the right way and remains sharp and crisp for an excellent viewing experience.</li><li><strong>Video Format</strong> - The recommended video format for Snapchat clips is <strong>MP4 and MOV. Y</strong>ou can use either of those formats on your Mac.</li><li><strong>Aspect Ratio</strong> - This is one of the key aspects of any video that determines the orientation of viewing. For a perfect Snapchat video, it is recommended that you keep the aspect ratio to <strong>9:16</strong>.</li><li><strong>Video Length Size</strong> - Remember that Snapchat isn’t like YouTube and serves an audience that wants micro-entertainment. This is why the recommended time for your video is <strong>3 to 10 seconds</strong> with the video size <strong>not exceeding 32 MB</strong>. Otherwise, the Snapchat audience may not respond well to your videos.</li></ul><p>That is why it is crucial that your Snapchat video has all the ideal features so your audience can enjoy the viewing experience as intended instead of attempting to manipulate their phones to be able to see the video clearly.

In this section, you can learn <strong>how to send snaps from the camera roll</strong> without capturing a live snap. For this, we will explain some manual methods as well as some reliable apps in a detailed manner.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Using-a-Snapchat-Filter"><a href="#Method-1-Using-a-Snapchat-Filter" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Using a Snapchat Filter"></a>Method 1: Using a Snapchat Filter</h3><p>Snapchat allows you to apply its filters on any of your camera roll’s pictures. By selecting a particular photo or video from your memories or snap, you can instantly add a filter to them. Afterward, you can send the filtered image to your friends as a regular snap. However, this solution has a significant drawback that you must know. The limitation is that the receiver of the snap would be able to see that the sent picture is from the camera roll.</p><p>Step1 Open your Snapchat and swipe up to open the ‘Memories’. Go to your Camera Roll and select any particular picture from there.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/send-snaps-from-camera-roll-1.jpg"                      alt="access camera roll tab"                ></p><p>Step2 After choosing a particular photo, tap on the “<strong>Edit</strong>“ icon at the bottom left corner. You can apply filters to the photo by swiping from right to left. Keep swiping until you can find your preferred filter.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/send-snaps-from-camera-roll-2.jpg"                      alt="tap on edit option"                ></p><p>Step1 Once you have applied the filter to the photo, touch on the “Send To” button. Choose any Snapchat friend to whom you want to send the picture. Next, hit the “Send” icon again to send the photo successfully.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/send-snaps-from-camera-roll-3.jpg"                      alt="tap on send to button"                ></p><h3 id="Method-2-Using-a-Sticker"><a href="#Method-2-Using-a-Sticker" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Using a Sticker"></a>Method 2: Using a Sticker</h3><p>If you want to make your camera roll picture funny and entertaining, you can add stickers to it. Through Snapchat, you can make your customized sticker of any interesting face or object. Moreover, Snapchat also offers a huge variety of built-in stickers. If you don’t want to create a customized sticker, you can easily add the built-in sticker with a single tap.</p><p>Step1 Once you have opened your Snapchat, go to Memories. From there, you can access and select any picture from the Camera Roll.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/send-snaps-from-camera-roll-4.jpg"                      alt="choose camera roll option"                ></p><p>Step2 After selecting a specific picture from Camera Roll, tap on the “Pencil” icon at the bottom left corner to edit the photo. Afterward, select the “Scissor” icon from the right section. Using the Snapchat Scissor, you can create a sticker of any face or object you find interesting. Just select any area of the photo using your finger.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/send-snaps-from-camera-roll-5.jpg"                      alt="create your sticker"                ></p><p>Step3 Now close the picture opened for creating the sticker. Once done, take a snap from your Snapchat to proceed. Now from the right section, tap on the “Sticker” icon. Here, you can choose the built-in stickers easily. Or you can navigate to the “Scissor” icon to select your created sticker.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/send-snaps-from-camera-roll-6.jpg"                      alt="access the created stickers"                ></p><p>Step4 Once done with adding and adjusting the sticker, hit the “Send To” button. Choose your preferred contact and tap on the “Send” icon again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/send-snaps-from-camera-roll-7.jpg"                      alt="hit the send to button"                ></p><h3 id="Method-3-Using-the-LMK-App"><a href="#Method-3-Using-the-LMK-App" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Using the LMK App"></a>Method 3: Using the LMK App</h3><p>Another efficient way to send a camera roll picture as a regular snap is by using a third-party app. LMK is a reliable social media platform that enables you to communicate with friends having similar interests. You can craft your profile by adding your interests and hobbies.</p><p>It helps people to create a safe and healthy community for enhanced communication. In this solution, we will guide you on <strong>how to send</strong> <strong>snaps from the camera roll</strong> using the LMK app. Through this app, you can send snaps to your friends without mentioning the camera roll.</p><p>Step1 Open your Snapchat either from your Android or iOS device. Proceed to the Memories section and select Camera Roll.

From the displayed options, tap on the “Download” icon to save the picture on your device gallery.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/send-snaps-from-camera-roll-9.jpg"                      alt="download the selected photo"                ></p><p>Step3 Now head to your Play Store or App Store according to the OS of your mobile device.

Afterward, tap on “Post” and hit the “Camera” icon from the bottom left side. Now choose the photo that you have recently saved in your gallery.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/send-snaps-from-camera-roll-11.jpg"                      alt="tap on camera icon"                ></p><p>Step5 After choosing the photo from the gallery, tap “Post to Snapchat.” By doing so, you will be redirected to your Snapchat. From your image, remove the added stickers of the LMK app. You can drag the sticker to the trash bin icon. Afterward, tap on the “Paper Clip” icon to remove the added attachment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/send-snaps-from-camera-roll-12.jpg"                      alt="remove the sticker and link"                ></p><p>Step6 Once done with removing the sticker and attached link, hit the “Send” button.

In this section, you can learn <strong>how to send snaps from the camera roll</strong> without capturing a live snap. For this, we will explain some manual methods as well as some reliable apps in a detailed manner.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Using-a-Snapchat-Filter-1"><a href="#Method-1-Using-a-Snapchat-Filter-1" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Using a Snapchat Filter"></a>Method 1: Using a Snapchat Filter</h3><p>Snapchat allows you to apply its filters on any of your camera roll’s pictures. By selecting a particular photo or video from your memories or snap, you can instantly add a filter to them. Afterward, you can send the filtered image to your friends as a regular snap. However, this solution has a significant drawback that you must know. The limitation is that the receiver of the snap would be able to see that the sent picture is from the camera roll.</p><p>Step1 Open your Snapchat and swipe up to open the ‘Memories’. Go to your Camera Roll and select any particular picture from there.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/send-snaps-from-camera-roll-1.jpg"                      alt="access camera roll tab"                ></p><p>Step2 After choosing a particular photo, tap on the “<strong>Edit</strong>“ icon at the bottom left corner. You can apply filters to the photo by swiping from right to left. Keep swiping until you can find your preferred filter.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/send-snaps-from-camera-roll-2.jpg"                      alt="tap on edit option"                ></p><p>Step1 Once you have applied the filter to the photo, touch on the “Send To” button. Choose any Snapchat friend to whom you want to send the picture. Next, hit the “Send” icon again to send the photo successfully.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/send-snaps-from-camera-roll-3.jpg"                      alt="tap on send to button"                ></p><h3 id="Method-2-Using-a-Sticker-1"><a href="#Method-2-Using-a-Sticker-1" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Using a Sticker"></a>Method 2: Using a Sticker</h3><p>If you want to make your camera roll picture funny and entertaining, you can add stickers to it.

Though, to rival other apps like Instagram and TikTok, Snapchat has recently added a “Sound” feature. With this newly-added option, users can add music to a Snapchat video pretty easily and make their snaps more interesting. In this post, I’m going to let you know how to add music to a Snapchat video without any hassle. Let’s get it started and level-up your Snapchat game!</p><h2 id="Part-1-What’s-the-Sound-Feature-in-Snapchat"><a href="#Part-1-What’s-the-Sound-Feature-in-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What’s the Sound Feature in Snapchat?"></a>Part 1: What’s the Sound Feature in Snapchat?</h2><p>Before we learn how to add music to your Snapchat video, let’s quickly get to know about the “Sounds” feature of the app. If you have been using Instagram or TikTok, then you might be familiar with their music feature.</p><p>Similarly, in 2020, Snapchat has also included a Sound feature that lets us add music to our snaps (photos or videos). For this, you can integrate Snapchat with a streaming service like Spotify, Pandora, Apple Music, or Soundcloud. While it doesn’t include all sorts of tracks, you can find most of the popular songs so that you can easily add music to a Snapchat video and make it interesting.</p><p>Once the other person would view your snap, they can hear the music playing in the background. If they want to listen to it or know more about the song, then they can just tap on its sticker on your snap.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Add-Music-to-a-Snapchat-Video-on-iPhone-or-Android"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Add-Music-to-a-Snapchat-Video-on-iPhone-or-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Add Music to a Snapchat Video on iPhone or Android?"></a>Part 2: How to Add Music to a Snapchat Video on iPhone or Android?</h2><p>One of the best things about Snapchat is that the overall interface of the app is pretty similar for both iOS and Android versions. Therefore, to learn how to add music on a Snapchat video, you need to follow the same process. As of now, you can find almost all the popular songs on Snapchat and can even record your own sounds.</p><p>To learn how to add music to your Snapchat video on your Android or iOS device, you can just follow this simple drill.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Visit the Snapchat Sound section on the app</strong></p><p>At first, just launch the Snapchat application on your device and tap on the camera icon from the home to start recording.</p><p>Using the rear or front camera of your device, you can now record any video on Snapchat. Once the video is recorded, you can tap on the music icon from the sidebar to add a song to a Snapchat video.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Search for any music to include in your Snaps</strong></p><p>As you would tap on the <strong>Music</strong> icon, you can view a list of various songs supported by Snapchat. If you want to look for anything specific, then just tap on the search icon and enter keywords to find a song of your choice.</p><p>Afterward, Snapchat will list the searched results, and you can tap on the play icon to first listen to the song. Just tap on the icon of the song and click on the “Next” button from the bottom to include it in the snap.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Trim and add the song to your Snapchat video</strong></p><p>Now, Snapchat will automatically display the snippet of the music at the bottom. You can use the left or the right slider option to trim the section of the music you want to add. Here, you also can tap on the play icon to listen to the track first.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Add music to your Snapchat video after recording</strong></p><p>That’s it! Once you have trimmed the music snippet, you can post it. You can tap on the shutter or the download icon first to save the video on your phone.</p><p>Now, you can preview the music via its sticker. You can just tap on the music sticker to change its appearance or drag it on the screen to place it anywhere you like. To change its size, you can just pinch-in or pinch-out the sticker.</p><p>In the end, just tap on the send icon to post your snap. You can add it to your story or sent it to any Snapchat contact. When they would open it, they can listen to the added song and even tap on the sticker to load it.</p><p>In this way, anyone can learn how to put music on a Snapchat video without any hassle.</p><h2 id="Part-3-FAQs-on-Adding-Music-to-a-Snapchat-Video"><a href="#Part-3-FAQs-on-Adding-Music-to-a-Snapchat-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: FAQs on Adding Music to a Snapchat Video"></a>Part 3: FAQs on Adding Music to a Snapchat Video</h2><p>Now when you know how to add music to your Snapchat video, let’s clear some common doubts related to it.</p><ul><li><strong>How to add your own music to a Snapchat video?</strong></li></ul><p>Apart from the available songs on Snapchat, the app also lets us add the sound of our choice. For this, just click on the music icon and tap the “Create Sound” button instead. This will let you record anything or create your own music on Snapchat.</p><ul><li><strong>Why are some songs not available on Snapchat?</strong></li></ul><p>The Sound feature of Snapchat only provides licensed music by collaborating with some of the biggest record labels. Therefore, while you can find most of the popular songs, chances are that some of them might be missing from the collection.</p><ul><li><strong>Why can’t I add music to my Snapchat videos?</strong></li></ul><p>Well, there could be two possible reasons for this – you might be using an old version of Snapchat or the feature might not be available in your region yet. To fix this, you can just go to the Snapchat page on the App&#x2F;Play Store and tap on the “Update” button. Furthermore, if the Sound feature has not been rolled out to your region, then you can just wait for a while.</p><p>As you can see, it is pretty easy to learn how to add music to a Snapchat video like a pro. With the newly-added Sounds feature, it is pretty easy to add a song to your Snapchat videos and make them more interesting.

Ideas To Create And Send Snaps Quickly"></a>Tip 1. Ideas To Create And Send Snaps Quickly</h3><p>Below are some tips&#x2F;ideas to help you quickly create and send Snaps to keep your Snapchat streak alive:</p><p><strong>Idea 1. Edit Blank Snap And Send As New Snap</strong></p><p>If you have run out of snap ideas, don’t worry about sending a high-quality one. No one is judging you, so send a blank snap to keep the streak alive; however, edit it a little so it looks like you have put in some effort.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/sending-a-blank-screen-to-keep-streak-alive.jpg"                      alt="sending a blank screen to keep streak alive"                ></p><p><strong>Idea 2. Send Black Screen</strong></p><p>Your Snapstreaks are about to expire, and you’re freaking out? Here’s a little hack that will keep them alive: send a black screen snap. That’s right! You can also add some doodles or stickers to the picture to make things look more interesting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/sending-blank-screen-as-snap.jpg"                      alt="sending blank screen as snap"                ></p><p><strong>Idea 3. Use Emojis And Bitmojis</strong></p><p>You can also add emojis or Bitmojis to your photos to make them look more interesting and fun. Simply open up the Snapchat app, click a picture, and tap on the emoji icon to select the emoji or Bitmoji that you want to add to your Snap. You can even resize and move them around to get it just right.</p><p><strong>Idea 4. Snap With Your Pets</strong></p><p>We all love our pets - and we also like staying connected with our friends on Snapchat. So why not combine the two? Occasionally take a picture of your pet using the app and send it to your besties to make their day and keep the streak alive!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/snap-with-pet-to-maintain-streak.jpg"                      alt="snap with pet to maintain streak"                ></p><p><strong>Idea 5. Streak With Daily Food</strong></p><p>Food is always a good topic and can be one of the best ways to keep your Snapchat streak alive. Simply send a snap to your friend every day before you start munching.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/streak-daily-food.jpg"                      alt="streak daily food"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-2-Seize-Occasions-And-Keep-Your-Snapchat-Sneak-Alive"><a href="#Tip-2-Seize-Occasions-And-Keep-Your-Snapchat-Sneak-Alive" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2. Seize Occasions And Keep Your Snapchat Sneak Alive"></a>Tip 2. Seize Occasions And Keep Your Snapchat Sneak Alive</h3><p>To keep your Snapchat streak alive, try to seize any opportunity you can to take pictures and send them to friends. Below are some ideas to do this:</p><p><strong>Idea 1. The First Day Matters</strong></p><p>Many people choose to start their streaks on special days because it helps them remember to keep them alive. For example, if you start your streak on your birthday, you’ll always remember to keep the streak going on, and it will also help you to grab the attention of people.</p><p><strong>Idea 2. Memorable Day</strong></p><p>We all have memorable days in our lives, like a milestone, graduation, or special event that we want to remember forever. What is a better way to commemorate them than with a Snap? Your friends and family will appreciate it, and you will be able to keep your streak alive for days to come.</p><p><strong>Idea 3. Streak While Traveling</strong></p><p>Whenever you are on a trip, travel to your office&#x2F;college, or head out to run some errands, remember to take a picture of the surroundings that look interesting and send it to whom you are establishing the streak.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/send-snapstreak-while-traveling.jpg"                      alt="send snapstreak while traveling"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-3-Organize-Your-Snapchat-And-Your-Time"><a href="#Tip-3-Organize-Your-Snapchat-And-Your-Time" class="headerlink" title="Tip 3. Organize Your Snapchat And Your Time"></a>Tip 3. Organize Your Snapchat And Your Time</h3><p>Are you trying to get the most out of Snapchat without letting it take over your life? Below we’ve provided some ideas to help you organize your time and your snaps.</p><p><strong>Idea 1. Edit the Name of your Snapchat Friends</strong></p><p>To avoid losing your Snapchat streaks with any of your contacts, you should start editing their names. Snapchat lists your most contacted friends at the top, so you might not see the others who are lower on your list. Editing their names to include something that will help you search for them will make it easier to avoid forgetting to send them a snap regularly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/edit-the-name-of-your-snapchat-friend.jpg"                      alt="edit the name of your snapchat friend"                ></p><p><strong>Idea 2. Pin Your Conversations</strong></p><p>If you want to keep someone at the top of your chat list, consider pinning their chat. This will also ultimately help you send snaps to them without breaking the streak.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/pin-conversation-in-snapchat.jpg"                      alt="pin conversation in snapchat"                ></p><p><strong>Idea 3. Stick to a Particular Time of the Day</strong></p><p>You will gain more by starting your Snapstreaks later on in the day, especially if you are only sending one snap per day. This way, the hourglass emoji will be visible for a considerable amount of time before it expires.</p><p><strong>Idea 4. Check Your Filters</strong></p><p>If you’re trying to keep up with multiple Snapstreaks at once, it’s easy to forget who you’re on a streak with. But there’s a way to see them without going to your list of friends.</p><p>Whenever you’re about to send a new snap, swipe through the filters. Here, you’ll see a special Snapchat streak filter, which will show how many consecutive days of successful streak you have in big white numbers next to the fire emoji.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>In this article, we’ve compiled a list of fun and creative <strong>Snapchat streak ideas</strong> to help you stay connected with your friends.</p><p>Hopefully, by following these tips, you can now keep your Snapchat streak alive and stay connected with your contacts in a better and more engaging way!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><h2 id="Seamlessly-Backup-Your-Camera-Roll-Exporting-to-Snapchat-Made-Easy"><a href="#Seamlessly-Backup-Your-Camera-Roll-Exporting-to-Snapchat-Made-Easy" class="headerlink" title="Seamlessly Backup Your Camera Roll: Exporting to Snapchat Made Easy"></a>Seamlessly Backup Your Camera Roll: Exporting to Snapchat Made Easy</h2><p>Many people haven’t backed up their camera roll to Snapchat due to the default settings.

It indicates that you cannot save the camera roll videos which exceed the 10-second limit. Furthermore, there are various ways that enable you to make a Camera Roll backup on Snapchat. In this part, we will guide you on how to save a Camera roll photo or video on Snapchat without creating a story. Also, these steps are applicable on both Android and iOS devices:</p><p>Step1 After opening your Snapchat app, open your Memories by swiping up.
