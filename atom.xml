However, Snapchat marketing can be challenging, as the platform constantly evolves and changes.</p><p>This article provides an overview of <strong>Snapchat marketing strategy,</strong> including why businesses should market on this platform, what types of content to post, and how to measure results.</p><p>With the information available in this article, you will be able to create a strategy that works for your business and get succeeded.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/snapchat-app.jpg"                      alt="snapchat app"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Snapchat-Overview"><a href="#Part-1-Snapchat-Overview" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Snapchat Overview"></a>Part 1. Snapchat Overview</h2><p>Firstly, let’s have an overview of Snapchat before we see how to draw your blueprint in Part 3 and Part 4.</p><p>Snapchat - founded by Evan Spiegel, Bobby Murphy, and Reggie Brown - is a unique messaging app because it allows users to send disappearing messages and photos. This feature has made the app popular with young people aged 13-34 who want to communicate without leaving a permanent record.</p><p>As of May 2022, Snapchat has <a class="link"   href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/545967/snapchat-app-dau/#:~:text=How%20many%20daily%20active%20users,increase%20of%20over%2018%20percent." >347 million daily active users. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> That’s impressive growth from its humble beginnings back in 2011. With <a class="link"   href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/272014/global-social-networks-ranked-by-number-of-users/" >monthly active users of 557 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, Snapchat is ranked as the 12th most popular social media platform.</p><p>Not only that, the number of <a class="link"   href="https://www.omnicoreagency.com/snapchat-statistics/" >Snapchat daily video views is 18 billion, <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> making it the best platform to showcase your services&#x2F;products and generate more income. However, all this is only possible with the right <strong>Snapchat marketing strategy.</strong></p><h2 id="Part-2-Why-Should-Business-Market-On-Snapchat"><a href="#Part-2-Why-Should-Business-Market-On-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Why Should Business Market On Snapchat"></a>Part 2. Why Should Business Market On Snapchat</h2><p>So you are probably thinking why your business should be on Snapchat - because it’s popular with teenagers and young adults. In fact, the platform has over 347 million daily active users, with <strong>75%</strong> being under the age of 34.</p><p>Therefore, if you’re targeting a younger demographic, then Snapchat should definitely be part of your social media marketing strategy.</p><p>Another big reason is that Snapchat is incredibly engaging. The average Snapchat user opens the app at least 20 times a day and spends 25 - 30 minutes on the app each day, so that’s a lot of potential exposure for your business.</p><p>Not only that, but since Snapchat is still a new field and opened up <a class="link"   href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/20/snapchat-messaging-app-ad-creepy-ouija" >ads to users in October 2014, <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> many big companies have not entered the market. This has created a huge opportunity for small businesses to market their products and generate leads to increase their sales.</p><p>With Snapchat, you can get discovered by users in their Discovery feeds or via Stories. Also, they can interact with your brand using the Geofilters, stickers, and lenses you’ve produced during your ad campaign.</p><p>For instance, Taco Bell created a filter for Cinco de Mayo. The filter received 224 Million views, which is insane. Nevertheless, this campaign kept users engaged and helped increase Taco Bell’s sales.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/taco-bell-cinco-de-mayo-filter-on-snapchat.jpg"                      alt="taco bell cinco de mayo filter on snapchat"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Where-To-Start-Your-Snapchat-Marketing-Strategy"><a href="#Part-3-Where-To-Start-Your-Snapchat-Marketing-Strategy" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

A cameo is an option that allows you to add your face to comic characters or animals or even create funny videos with them. You become a star of looping, short videos that you can send across to your friends. It is a great way to express your emotions in moments. Instead of messages, <strong>Snapchat cameos</strong> are an innovative way to say hello, express your feelings, and so forth.

This is especially useful if you wish to let someone know how you feel but you are unsure of what their reactions would be.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AIMmjowaFs4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/Y5UmwDaI7HU/s250-c-k/photo.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Liza Brown</p><p>Liza Brown is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Liza Brown</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/new-decoding-the-purpose-why-does-fb-use-a-blue-icon/"><u>[New] Decoding the Purpose Why Does FB Use a Blue Icon?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/new-tailoring-mac-videos-to-fit-snapchat-dimensions/"><u>[New] Tailoring Mac Videos to Fit Snapchat Dimensions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-crescendo-video-tips-for-music-loving-snapchaters/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Crescendo Video Tips for Music-Loving Snapchaters</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-the-rise-of-micro-video-a-tiktok-vs-snapchat-study/"><u>[Updated] The Rise of Micro-Video A TikTok vs Snapchat Study</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/bypass-connections-ps3-dualshock-on-windows/"><u>Bypass Connections: PS3-DualShock on Windows</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/from-static-to-spinning-mastering-photo-effects-in-illustrator/"><u>From Static to Spinning Mastering Photo Effects in Illustrator</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-ultimate-periscope-user-manual/"><u>In 2024, The Ultimate Periscope User Manual</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-tutorial-to-change-itel-p55plus-imei-without-root-a-comprehensive-guide-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Tutorial to Change Itel P55+ IMEI without Root A Comprehensive Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/er-kit-the-essential-youtube-setup-for-2024/"><u>Starter Kit The Essential YouTube Setup for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Though, to rival other apps like Instagram and TikTok, Snapchat has recently added a “Sound” feature. With this newly-added option, users can add music to a Snapchat video pretty easily and make their snaps more interesting. In this post, I’m going to let you know how to add music to a Snapchat video without any hassle. Let’s get it started and level-up your Snapchat game!</p><h2 id="Part-1-What’s-the-Sound-Feature-in-Snapchat"><a href="#Part-1-What’s-the-Sound-Feature-in-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What’s the Sound Feature in Snapchat?"></a>Part 1: What’s the Sound Feature in Snapchat?</h2><p>Before we learn how to add music to your Snapchat video, let’s quickly get to know about the “Sounds” feature of the app. If you have been using Instagram or TikTok, then you might be familiar with their music feature.</p><p>Similarly, in 2020, Snapchat has also included a Sound feature that lets us add music to our snaps (photos or videos). For this, you can integrate Snapchat with a streaming service like Spotify, Pandora, Apple Music, or Soundcloud. While it doesn’t include all sorts of tracks, you can find most of the popular songs so that you can easily add music to a Snapchat video and make it interesting.</p><p>Once the other person would view your snap, they can hear the music playing in the background. If they want to listen to it or know more about the song, then they can just tap on its sticker on your snap.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Add-Music-to-a-Snapchat-Video-on-iPhone-or-Android"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Add-Music-to-a-Snapchat-Video-on-iPhone-or-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Add Music to a Snapchat Video on iPhone or Android?"></a>Part 2: How to Add Music to a Snapchat Video on iPhone or Android?</h2><p>One of the best things about Snapchat is that the overall interface of the app is pretty similar for both iOS and Android versions. Therefore, to learn how to add music on a Snapchat video, you need to follow the same process. As of now, you can find almost all the popular songs on Snapchat and can even record your own sounds.</p><p>To learn how to add music to your Snapchat video on your Android or iOS device, you can just follow this simple drill.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Visit the Snapchat Sound section on the app</strong></p><p>At first, just launch the Snapchat application on your device and tap on the camera icon from the home to start recording.</p><p>Using the rear or front camera of your device, you can now record any video on Snapchat. Once the video is recorded, you can tap on the music icon from the sidebar to add a song to a Snapchat video.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Search for any music to include in your Snaps</strong></p><p>As you would tap on the <strong>Music</strong> icon, you can view a list of various songs supported by Snapchat. If you want to look for anything specific, then just tap on the search icon and enter keywords to find a song of your choice.</p><p>Afterward, Snapchat will list the searched results, and you can tap on the play icon to first listen to the song. Just tap on the icon of the song and click on the “Next” button from the bottom to include it in the snap.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Trim and add the song to your Snapchat video</strong></p><p>Now, Snapchat will automatically display the snippet of the music at the bottom. You can use the left or the right slider option to trim the section of the music you want to add. Here, you also can tap on the play icon to listen to the track first.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Add music to your Snapchat video after recording</strong></p><p>That’s it! Once you have trimmed the music snippet, you can post it. You can tap on the shutter or the download icon first to save the video on your phone.</p><p>Now, you can preview the music via its sticker. You can just tap on the music sticker to change its appearance or drag it on the screen to place it anywhere you like. To change its size, you can just pinch-in or pinch-out the sticker.</p><p>In the end, just tap on the send icon to post your snap. You can add it to your story or sent it to any Snapchat contact. When they would open it, they can listen to the added song and even tap on the sticker to load it.</p><p>In this way, anyone can learn how to put music on a Snapchat video without any hassle.</p><h2 id="Part-3-FAQs-on-Adding-Music-to-a-Snapchat-Video"><a href="#Part-3-FAQs-on-Adding-Music-to-a-Snapchat-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: FAQs on Adding Music to a Snapchat Video"></a>Part 3: FAQs on Adding Music to a Snapchat Video</h2><p>Now when you know how to add music to your Snapchat video, let’s clear some common doubts related to it.</p><ul><li><strong>How to add your own music to a Snapchat video?</strong></li></ul><p>Apart from the available songs on Snapchat, the app also lets us add the sound of our choice. For this, just click on the music icon and tap the “Create Sound” button instead. This will let you record anything or create your own music on Snapchat.</p><ul><li><strong>Why are some songs not available on Snapchat?</strong></li></ul><p>The Sound feature of Snapchat only provides licensed music by collaborating with some of the biggest record labels. Therefore, while you can find most of the popular songs, chances are that some of them might be missing from the collection.</p><ul><li><strong>Why can’t I add music to my Snapchat videos?</strong></li></ul><p>Well, there could be two possible reasons for this – you might be using an old version of Snapchat or the feature might not be available in your region yet. To fix this, you can just go to the Snapchat page on the App&#x2F;Play Store and tap on the “Update” button. Furthermore, if the Sound feature has not been rolled out to your region, then you can just wait for a while.</p><p>As you can see, it is pretty easy to learn how to add music to a Snapchat video like a pro. With the newly-added Sounds feature, it is pretty easy to add a song to your Snapchat videos and make them more interesting. Go ahead and try this feature to make your snaps creative and share this guide with others to teach them how do you add music to a Snapchat video as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Ollie Mattison</p><p>Ollie Mattison is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Ollie Mattison</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-how-to-smoothly-view-youtube-videos-without-borders/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved How to Smoothly View YouTube Videos without Borders?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/new-embrace-artistic-expression-incorporating-anime-into-snapchat/"><u>[New] Embrace Artistic Expression Incorporating Anime Into Snapchat</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/new-the-cheapest-cloud-storage-service-for-mass-file/"><u>[New] The Cheapest Cloud Storage Service for Mass File</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-top-12-free-youtube-thumbnail-makers-filmora/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Top 12 Free YouTube Thumbnail Makers - Filmora</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-a-deep-dive-into-video-platform-wars-tiktok-vs-snapchat/"><u>[Updated] A Deep Dive Into Video Platform Wars TikTok vs Snapchat</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-audio-addition-for-snapchat-videos/"><u>[Updated] Audio Addition for Snapchat Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-crafting-an-easy-to-use-youtube-subscription-tagline/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Crafting an Easy-to-Use YouTube Subscription Tagline</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-decoding-snapchat-emoji-language/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Decoding Snapchat Emoji Language</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/updated-metaverse-musings-arvr-inclusive-quotes-collection/"><u>[Updated] Metaverse Musings AR/VR-Inclusive Quotes Collection</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-perfect-pairing-transferring-camera-roll-content-effortlessly-to-snapchat/"><u>[Updated] Perfect Pairing Transferring Camera Roll Content Effortlessly to Snapchat</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-recover-lost-photos-on-snapchat/"><u>[Updated] Recover Lost Photos on Snapchat</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/exclusive-prime-day-offers-for-your-favorite-apple-gadgets/"><u>Exclusive Prime Day Offers for Your Favorite Apple Gadgets</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-infinix-zero-5g-2023-turbo-phone-without-pin-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Unlock Infinix Zero 5G 2023 Turbo Phone without PIN</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-vivo-s17-pro-phone-without-any-data-loss-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Unlock Vivo S17 Pro Phone without Any Data Loss</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/render-your-social-media-footage-for-2024/"><u>Render Your Social Media Footage for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/top-alternatives-to-microsoft-office-the-ultimate-guide/"><u>Top Alternatives to Microsoft Office : The Ultimate Guide</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135348/19272" target="_top" id="2135348">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135348" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135348/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>

Snapchat Overview"></a>Part 1. Snapchat Overview</h2><p>There is a saying goes: <em>Know the weather, know the terrain, and your victory will be complete.</em> Before we look into the detailed guidance in <a href="#_Methods_To_Make">Part 2</a>, we should know more about Snapchat.</p><p>Snapchat is a photo messaging app developed on September 16, 2011, by Bobby Murphy,Reggie Brown, and Evan Spiegel while they were studying at Stanford University.</p><p>With Snapchat, you can take photos, record videos, add text and drawings, and send them to a controlled list of recipients. These sent MMS are known as “Snaps,” and you can set a time limit on how long recipients can view them (a maximum of 24 hours, after which they will be automatically deleted).</p><p>Since its inception, Snapchat has evolved to include a wider range of features, including live video chat, story sharing, and lenses (augmented reality filters). Each of these functions is discussed below in detail:</p><ul><li><strong>Chat:</strong> A messaging functionality you can use to communicate with your friends and family, share snaps, send stickers, or make a video&#x2F;audio call.</li><li><strong>Stories:</strong> With this feature, you can add a compilation of images or videos for public viewing - available for 24 hours and then automatically disappear.</li><li><strong>Live Stories:</strong> There are stories of other users from a specific location or event that disappear after 24 hours.</li><li><strong>Lenses:</strong> These AR filters can be used to add fun effects to your pictures and post them as your stories or send them to someone.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/snapchat-lens.jpg"                      alt="snapchat lens"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Filters:</strong> Unlike lenses, they are static photo <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >overlays&#x2F;effects <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that you can apply to your pictures to make them more captivating.</li><li><strong>Snap Map:</strong> This functionality lets you share your location with your friends. On the map, you will appear as a Bitmoji for them.</li><li><strong>Snapchat Spotlight:</strong> This is a TikTok-like feature helping many Snapchat users to make money. You can submit your best videos with a chance of earning a share of up to $1 million&#x2F;day, depending on the number of views.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Methods-To-Make-Money-On-Snapchat"><a href="#Part-2-Methods-To-Make-Money-On-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Methods To Make Money On Snapchat"></a>Part 2. Methods To Make Money On Snapchat</h2><p>Snapchat’s focus on short, time-limited content (your snaps&#x2F;stories stay only for 24 hours) encourages more personalized sharing and contrasts more substantial relationships between brands and customers.</p><p>So, how to make money on Snapchat?</p><p>Keep reading to find out!</p><h3 id="Method-1-Creating-Viral-Video"><a href="#Method-1-Creating-Viral-Video" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Creating Viral Video"></a>Method 1: Creating Viral Video</h3><p>When you submit your videos to Spotlight, Snapchat uses an algorithm to personalize the content to its viewers based on their interests by looking at factors such as how many times they watch a video, the number of skips, shares, and likes.</p><p>Thus, if your videos get more viewers and become viral, you will start earning money real quick. With that being said, let’s understand with a report to see how you can begin making millions with your viral videos on Snapchat.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://biographydaily.com/2022/07/27/cam-casey/" >Cam Casey <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, 19 years old TikTok star, decided to post his science experiment involving the explosion of a Coca-Cola bottle on Snapchat.

If you’re struggling to develop <strong>ideas to post on Snapchat</strong>, don’t worry - we’ve got you covered.</p><p>Below we’ve provided some tips for your Snapchat videos:</p><h3 id="Idea-1-Conduct-Interviews-Via-Snaps"><a href="#Idea-1-Conduct-Interviews-Via-Snaps" class="headerlink" title="Idea 1. Conduct Interviews Via Snaps"></a>Idea 1. Conduct Interviews Via Snaps</h3><p>If you are running your Snapchat like a YouTube channel, conducting interviews on Snapchat is a perfect way to get quick, candid responses from your interviewees. To make it more fun, captivating, and engaging, you can also use captivating Snaps to add a personal touch.</p><p>All you need is: set lighting and sound, a 10-second snap with a question on it, and the interviewee. Start by introducing the person in the frame, put the snap on the screen, and let the interviewee answer your question.</p><p>To make things interesting, add <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >filters <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, stickers, or <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >lenses <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to reflect the scenarios or your personality.

Host A YouTube And Snapchat Q&amp;A"></a>Idea 2. Host A YouTube And Snapchat Q&amp;A</h3><p>Another great idea is to host a YouTube and Snapchat Q&amp;A. You can film with a famous snap chatter or YouTuber and ask them a few questions. You can also ask your followers&#x2F;audience to send their questions via text message or response to your stories. This will help you get your viewers involved with your content and increase engagement.</p><p>To make sure your snap Q&amp;A goes off without a hitch, be sure to:</p><ul><li>Set up your Snapchat settings of <strong>“Who Can Contact Me”</strong> to <strong>“Everyone”</strong> for a while to allow for questions.</li><li>During the session, try to acknowledge who asked the question.</li><li>After the session, change the “<strong>Who Can Contact Me”</strong> setting back to <strong>only friends</strong> to avoid spam overload.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/snapchat-qa-session-via-stories.jpg"                      alt="snapchat q a session via stories"                ></p><h3 id="Idea-3-Fun-Tidbits"><a href="#Idea-3-Fun-Tidbits" class="headerlink" title="Idea 3.

The service has launched several innovative features over the years and one of their latest and popular tools is cameos. It is a fun way that one can express themselves, with their own faces plastered on comic characters or on bodies of animals and so forth.</p><ol><li><strong>What is a Snapchat Cameo?</strong></li></ol><p>If you have been seeing your friends add their faces to fun emojis, cartoons, and other figures, you could do that too with this fun feature on Snapchat. A cameo is an option that allows you to add your face to comic characters or animals or even create funny videos with them. You become a star of looping, short videos that you can send across to your friends. It is a great way to express your emotions in moments. Instead of messages, <strong>Snapchat cameos</strong> are an innovative way to say hello, express your feelings, and so forth. It is possible to customize captions and add them to the cameos that you create.</p><p>These are easy to add and send in chat messages since it is an option that occurs next to the stickers. It is available on the apps created for Android and iOS devices. You can choose from more than 150 cameos which makes it a great feature.</p><p>Indeed, who would not want to have cool means to express themselves, their opinions, or tell their close friends what they feel? Snapchat offers several unique ways of expressing yourself. While you could attach videos or memes that express what you feel, with a cameo you can make that even more personalized and unique. Add your face to cool videos, animations, or pics. What’s more, you can add text in different fonts and with interesting effects. It is nothing short of creating a video by yourself. That too can be easily done in a matter of seconds, while you are on chat with your friends or loved ones.</p><ol><li><strong>How to Use Snapchat Cameo?</strong></li></ol><p>There are easy ways to get started when using <strong>Snapchat cameos</strong>. All you need is to tap on the button provided, on the sticker bar. It involves taking a selfie or choosing a picture or a video that you already have on your phone or tablet. If a friend has set up the feature in their Snapchat and is chatting live, it is possible to co-star in it together.</p><p>Here are simple ways to get started:</p><ul><li>Start by choosing a contact on the Snap list with whom you wish to start a conversation or want to send a pic or video using this feature. You will find the functionality while you are texting and adding effects to the conversation. For this reason, the function appears in the borders of the keyboard you use.</li><li>Once the chat page opens up, find the face icon next to the chat bar which shows above the keyboard. This leads to the emoji page along where you will find the <strong>Snapchat cameos</strong> option at the bottom.</li><li>You will find the cameo icon at the bottom of this section. It looks like a face with a + sign on it. This will lead you to create the cameo video or pic.</li><li>It starts by activating the selfie camera. It aligns the face on the camera with an outline in blue. It will instruct you to take the selfie picture.</li><li>You will then get options for adding filters to the cameo of your face. This can consist of pictures you have in your gallery or a repository of images and cartoons that the app provides. You could also source images from the internet or videos to use for this purpose.</li><li>Once the filters are applied and captions added, you are ready to send across the cameo to your selected contact. The <strong>Snapchat cameos</strong> you create get added to the chat option directly.</li><li>It is also possible to create a two-person cameo, especially if the person’s pics are available on your gallery of images. You can also add text to make the pics more expressive.</li></ul><ol><li><strong>How to Fix Snapchat Cameo Not Showing up?</strong></li></ol><p>Users of the Snapchat app can use cameo as one of the innovative new features that help them add their faces to funny videos, cartoons, and so forth. However, in certain instances, the cameos might not show up. In such cases you can fix such issues with the following steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Update App</strong></li></ul><p>This is a solution that might prove effective. You could opt for updating the app by downloading the latest version of the app from the Apple or Android app store. Once the app updates and installs, you might find that the issue is resolved. One could also use the beta version of the app available at online stores.</p><ul><li><strong>Check Settings on the Phone</strong></li></ul><p>This is another possible way to get the issue resolved. Visit the phone settings. Opt for the section on app management. Here search for the Snapchat app. Here you could opt to uninstall and use Force Stop. Visit storage options and clear all data. You can then restart your phone. Once you open the app you could find the cameo issue resolved.</p><ul><li><strong>Install VPN</strong></li></ul><p>There could be instances when the feature does not show up in the app due to the restrictions that countries impose. Users can install VPN in such an instance. This will then help resolve the issue. One could then reinstall the app and find the feature available on the app.</p><p>One of the above resolutions usually proves effective if you are unable to find <strong>Snapchat cameos</strong> on your app. If your phone or tablet is of an older version that does not support the app or you are using a simulator platform, you might not find this update in the version you use.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Here we understand what is the <strong>Snapchat cameos</strong> feature that one can find and how to use it. It is one of the new features that the social media service has introduced. It helps animate photos and videos with a selfie of the user. The photos and videos that the user creates with this feature can be easily shared with the contacts of the user. It is a feature that is easy to use on the app. One can get started by using their faces on the latest memes that they find on the internet. Here we also discuss the different ways one can resolve problems that arise when this feature does not show up on the app.</p><p>So go ahead and be creative with your expressions. You can add a light note to your messages, create funny pics and videos and bring about a comic look and feel to a conversation. It is also a great way to express how you feel without having to be serious about it. This is especially useful if you wish to let someone know how you feel but you are unsure of what their reactions would be.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AIMmjowaFs4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/Y5UmwDaI7HU/s250-c-k/photo.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Liza Brown</p><p>Liza Brown is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Liza Brown</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/new-attenuating-audio-gradually-in-fl-projects/"><u>[New] Attenuating Audio Gradually in FL Projects</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/new-engaging-audiences-with-dynamic-and-attractive-snaps/"><u>[New] Engaging Audiences with Dynamic and Attractive Snaps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/new-top-humorous-snapchat-emojis-for-record-breaking-engagement/"><u>[New] Top Humorous Snapchat Emojis for Record-Breaking Engagement</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-decoding-app-dynamics-an-in-depth-analysis-of-tiktok-and-snaps-similarities/"><u>[Updated] Decoding App Dynamics An In-Depth Analysis of TikTok & Snap's Similarities</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-enhance-snapchat-stories-with-these-top-6-mobile-editors/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Enhance Snapchat Stories with These Top 6 Mobile Editors</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/ed-investigating-how-t-series-earns-from-youtube-viewership/"><u>[Updated] Investigating How T-Series Earns From YouTube Viewership</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/updated-the-balance-of-swiftness-and-security-on-spotify-sounds/"><u>[Updated] The Balance of Swiftness and Security on Spotify Sounds</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/effortlessly-integrating-obs-into-your-mac-step-by-step-guide/"><u>Effortlessly Integrating OBS Into Your Mac Step by Step Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://data-wizards.techidaily.com/expand-your-network-across-top-platforms-facebook-to-linkedin-and-youtube/"><u>Expand Your Network Across Top Platforms: Facebook to LinkedIn & YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-frp.techidaily.com/full-guide-to-bypass-motorola-moto-g24-frp-by-drfone-android/"><u>Full Guide to Bypass Motorola Moto G24 FRP</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-photos-from-honor-x50-gt-to-new-android-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>How to Transfer Photos from Honor X50 GT to New Android? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-transfer-contacts-from-lava-yuva-2-pro-to-other-android-devices-using-bluetooth-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Transfer Contacts from Lava Yuva 2 Pro to Other Android Devices Using Bluetooth? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-howtos.techidaily.com/ultimate-fixes-for-the-persistent-error-code-0x800705b4-on-your-windows-10-system/"><u>Ultimate Fixes for the Persistent Error Code 0X800705b4 on Your Windows 10 System</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1374819">                    <video width="200" height="200" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1374819.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15852-1374819">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1374819.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:125px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fthefitville.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1374819%2F15852'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1374819/15852"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>

You can craft your profile by adding your interests and hobbies.</p><p>It helps people to create a safe and healthy community for enhanced communication. In this solution, we will guide you on <strong>how to send</strong> <strong>snaps from the camera roll</strong> using the LMK app. Through this app, you can send snaps to your friends without mentioning the camera roll.</p><p>Step1 Open your Snapchat either from your Android or iOS device. Proceed to the Memories section and select Camera Roll. Here, tap on any picture that you want to send.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/send-snaps-from-camera-roll-8.jpg"                      alt="choose picture from camera roll"                ></p><p>Step2 Now hit the “Arrow” button to share the selected snap.

From there, download the LMK app. After its complete installation, open this app using your Snapchat login.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/send-snaps-from-camera-roll-10.jpg"                      alt="download and install lmk app"                ></p><p>Step4 On the LMK app, tap on the “Plus” icon to proceed.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> When you’re shopping for tablets, considering an iPad is almost inevitable. Launched in November of 2018, Apple’s new iPad Pro (11-inch) promised the world a number of bold changes to the original design, with sharper screens, better multitasking options, and a suite of new features that addressed past complaints. On the flip side, the Pro also commands a lofty price tag which raises the question, is this the iPad that can replace your laptop? We take a deep look at all aspects of its design, software, and performance to see if it lives up to those high expectations.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/jYGLTeSXEAGonvbdFrussmvvPDU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_2-74153fdc1da44cbba893312f82da0547.jpg"                      alt="IPad Pro 11-Inch"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><h2 id="Design-and-Features-Cutting-edge"><a href="#Design-and-Features-Cutting-edge" class="headerlink" title="Design and Features: Cutting edge"></a><strong>Design and Features: Cutting edge</strong></h2><p> The iPad Pro is easy to pick up with one hand and barely makes a dent in your backpack storage. It feels like a notepad, and you can use it as such. For what is inside this piece of kit, that is a marvel This device even fits snug into the accessory slot of a laptop sleeve if you’re planning to double up. It is dainty, but what makes it so wonderful is that there are no compromises to make up for this, design-wise.</p><p> Apple’s latest revision does away with buttons and fingerprint sensors altogether to create an edge-to-edge screen with a smaller bezel. To still ensure a sense of security it ships with Face ID, popularised by the iPhone X. This means that after registering your face you can simply open up your iPad, and it will unlock almost instantly if you’re in view of the device’s front-facing camera, regardless of orientation. By removing most (but not all) of the bezel and sanding down the edges, the new iPad Pro has a far more stylish design than its predecessors.</p><p> Perhaps one of the most striking decisions Apple has made here is the inclusion of a USB-C port, which replaces the Lightning port at the bottom of the device. This opens up a world of possibilities for most creative types, from easily connecting the iPad to a monitor, or even uploading photos you want to edit directly from your DSLR camera.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/TpucPEgB2OHgSplLwk2Q6sbI6Yo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_5-a6f20cf2b7b84caf8a6290fcb5e9fb5f.jpg"                      alt="Ipad Pro 11-Inch"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><h2 id="Accessories-Useful-for-productivity"><a href="#Accessories-Useful-for-productivity" class="headerlink" title="Accessories: Useful for productivity"></a><strong>Accessories: Useful for productivity</strong></h2><p> The two main attachments everyone should consider when purchasing an iPad Pro are the Apple Pencil and the Smart Keyboard Folio. The Apple Pencil is a powerful tool for artists and note takers, and the revised model includes a double-tap feature so you can quickly switch between brush styles and utilize functions usually locked off to the more PC-focused professional drawing tablets. Previous Apple Pencil users will be glad to know that it charges with a magnetic pad on the side of the device, and not awkwardly through the port at the bottom like previous models.</p><p> Yet, it does also drop the headphone jack, meaning you’re going to want a pair of wireless headphones or Airpods if you’re looking to edit video or listen to music on it in public. This would be ok if there was a USB-C to Lightning adaptor in the box, but Apple decided not to, which feels stingy, considering the price tag.</p><p> The Smart Keyboard Folio turns the iPad Pro into a writing machine and is an incredibly slick attachment with barely any heft to it. Simply snap your iPad in and it will let you type straight away. The fact it doubles up as a folio means you can give your device some much-needed protection without sacrificing productivity. Multiple magnets in the case ensure that your iPad can be wrapped up with care and stored safely when you’re on the move.</p><p> We wouldn’t call the iPad Pro child-friendly unless you wrap it in a rugged case and apply a decent screen protector, and even then it’s a stretch. Due to all of the productivity features, we believe the best use case for the tablet is in the hands of professionals rather than families. It’s for those who are looking for a premium tablet experience.</p><p> Top 3 Tablets On the Market</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137219/26400" target="_top" id="2137219">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137219" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137219/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Fast-and-easy"><a href="#Setup-Process-Fast-and-easy" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Fast and easy"></a><strong>Setup Process: Fast and easy</strong></h2><p> Setting up the 11-inch iPad Pro is quick and painless, and strikingly similar to many of Apple’s other products. Once unboxed, we took the iPad out of its case and held down on the power button which led to the setup screen.</p><p> Following this, we used our iPhone to scan the visual code on the screen which quickly linked the devices and ensured a smooth setup. If you don’t own any other Apple products, you are led through a short set of screens where you pick your time zone, sign into your Apple ID, and connect to your WiFi. As part of the setup process, you also have to orient your head around the camera to ensure Face ID can set you up properly for the multiple viewing angles. Once everything has updated, you simply swipe up and are let loose into the Apple home screen from where you can start downloading and installing your apps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/GV44W9kKlQd3SXT_XaWI-tjo6Cw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_6-2bcb5b2009154c92931411045a9b6ddc.jpg"                      alt="IPad Pro 11 inch"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><h2 id="Display-Rich-colors-and-smooth-motion"><a href="#Display-Rich-colors-and-smooth-motion" class="headerlink" title="Display: Rich colors and smooth motion"></a><strong>Display: Rich colors and smooth motion</strong></h2><p> Apple is well known for its gorgeous screens, and the iPad Pro absolutely delivers. The display is what Apple is calling ‘Liquid Retina’, an upgraded version of the technology that drives the screen on the iPhone XR. Wonderfully rich color reproduction, crisp text can be found across all of Apple’s proprietary apps and third-party optimized software. Reading articles and watching video content on streaming services is wonderful, and it even fares well amidst glare from sunlight. It’s still an LCD screen though, so OLED tablets will still have better-looking blacks and richer, more saturated colors. Fortunately for Apple, there aren’t many of those in the market.</p><p> There’s also some nifty usability features that come packed with the iPad Pro. True Tone is a feature that helps match the display to the color temperature of your surroundings, which makes the screen easier on your eyes. The 120Hz Pro Motion technology alters the refresh rate of the screen depending on your usage, which results in extremely fluid motion, from scrolling, to playing games, or watching video. It’s difficult to find a poor viewing angle, though you still can’t watch 4K video on YouTube, which is a crying shame given the power of the screen, but more of a problem between Apple and Google rather than a knock to the device itself.</p><h2 id="Performance-Powerhouse-processor"><a href="#Performance-Powerhouse-processor" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Powerhouse processor"></a><strong>Performance: Powerhouse processor</strong></h2><p> As touted by Apple during its launch presentation, the iPad Pro is said to be as powerful as an Xbox One S. This is true from a pure graphics perspective, but you have to consider that the iPad doesn’t have the same games or support, so while it is as powerful, it’s unlikely to replace your console anytime soon.</p><p> What it does have though is an unparalleled chip in the A12X Bionic, an utterly astounding eight-core processor that never breaks a sweat. In testing, we played PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, XCOM: Enemy Unknown, and Bully: Scholarship Edition which the iPad breezed through. It also functions perfectly with several intensive apps open. We tried switching between the games in-play to more productivity-focused tasks like video editing or sketching and it still never faltered.</p><p> The A12X Bionic puts it leagues ahead of the competition, making it the most powerful productivity machine for professional creatives on the market.</p><p> Our Geekbench 4 benchmarks put the iPad Pro’s Multi-Core CPU performance at 18090, almost double that of the previous generation model utilizing the A10X Fusion chip, which sat at 9301. Single core there was another significant jump, with 5019 to the previous iPad’s 3906.</p><p> In our GFX Metal tests, the iPad really ran away from its competitors too. It scored 3407 frames in the Car Chase benchmark, almost double that of the Nvidia Shield, and nearly triple that of the previous iPad, running at an incredible 57 FPS (frames per second) compared to the previous iPads 23 FPS. It’s a massive, almost overkill leap considering the lack of AAA experiences available for the device, but it’s nice to have all that power in your hands.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/KXfYew06x6vujxu5asiFMPptK_k=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_1-a6ce9e62649048d7a20596066576c2c5.jpg"                      alt="IPad Pro 11 inch"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123727/7443" target="_top" id="2123727">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123727" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123727/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><h2 id="Productivity-Not-a-laptop-replacement-just-yet"><a href="#Productivity-Not-a-laptop-replacement-just-yet" class="headerlink" title="Productivity: Not a laptop replacement just yet"></a><strong>Productivity: Not a laptop replacement just yet</strong></h2><p> The 2018 iPad Pro is an absolute force of nature as far as productivity is concerned. With the brilliant viewing angles, and options to attach both a nimble Apple Pencil and a Smart Keyboard to the device with relative ease, this tablet will suit the needs of many modern creatives and workers looking for an all-in-one device.</p><p> Will it replace your laptop though? This is a major point of contention for people looking to take the plunge. Over our two week testing period we ended up using the iPad Pro for nearly every aspect of our workflow as a freelance writer, but we still don’t think it’s quite there yet.</p><p> The main feature that is an essential asset to your productivity is the Split View, that lets you bring up two apps from the dock that share equal (or 75&#x2F;25) of the real estate of your screen. This means, for example, you could boot up Notability and Google Docs to transfer your notes into an article, or Procreate and Safari if you want to use a reference image whilst you draw. As you can imagine, the apps become intertwined thanks to the multitouch gestures, where you can drag words or images between the two and make your workflow far more efficient than it would be if you were using a standard laptop. A lot of apps are well integrated for iOS and often better than their PC counterparts, but it is still certainly a mixed bag, especially for Adobe power users, who still have to suffer watered down applications, though more fully-functioned apps are on the way.</p><p> It cannot replace your laptop just yet, but it may well make it redundant based on your use case.</p><p> Outside of that, you can’t connect some external drives, Thunderbolt devices or use a mouse. Split View is also certainly a compromise to professionals used to using more than three programs at once.</p><h2 id="Audio-Thunderous-sound"><a href="#Audio-Thunderous-sound" class="headerlink" title="Audio: Thunderous sound"></a><strong>Audio: Thunderous sound</strong></h2><p> One of the major upgrades to the Pro is the stereo effect audio playback with four powerful speakers, two on either side of the device. The iPad Pro has truly stunning audio, and if you crank it up it could easily act as a party speaker. There is absolutely no need for anything external when watching video content. Amazingly, the fidelity of the audio never seems to suffer, even at full volume. Apple ditching the headphone jack poses an interesting problem in that you’re going to need a pair of Bluetooth headphones or buy an adapter to receive audio on the go.</p><h2 id="Network-Reasonable-connectivity"><a href="#Network-Reasonable-connectivity" class="headerlink" title="Network: Reasonable connectivity"></a><strong>Network: Reasonable connectivity</strong></h2><p> In terms of signal strength, we struggled to get the WiFi to break by walking outside and away from our router. In the garden and the garage ( a usual drop-out spot for other devices) it held true in very reasonable fashion.</p><p> We received 72Mbps download speed and 6Mbps upload on our 100Mbps plan, a very respectable result. Downloading apps was quick and painless, and thanks to the incredible processor, there was very limited buffering time when booting up YouTube videos, Twitch streams and streaming video content on Netflix.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/D-1-WC_wIDqzRZLb8mDOgpjal6c=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_3-e425a67865fc461fb805e648294dadf8.jpg"                      alt="IPad- Pro 11 Inch"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2128843/7443" target="_top" id="2128843">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2128843" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2128843/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><h2 id="Camera-A-decent-backup"><a href="#Camera-A-decent-backup" class="headerlink" title="Camera: A decent backup"></a><strong>Camera: A decent backup</strong></h2><p> One of the only design compromises is the small camera bump on the back of the tablet that makes it wobble a negligible amount whilst flat outside of a case. It’s still unwieldy to use, and whilst it’s a wonder why a tablet like this even needs a camera at all, Apple has actually given the tablet a camera worthy of the price tag.</p><p> The rear camera is 12 MP and very similar to the technology seen in the iPhone XS. The 7 MP front-facing camera features the same ‘Portrait Mode’ technology found in the latest lineup of phones, meaning you can alter the depth-of-field on selfies which is a nice touch. FaceTime functions confidently without much blur, and you can record 4K 60fps video with absolutely faultless playback.</p><p> The Pro is great for demoing Augmented Reality (AR) content, but after a quick search of the App Store and some googling, you’ll soon realize there are very few compelling AR experiences on the market, so this is more of a work in progress.</p><p> Take a peek at some of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-iphone-camera-apps-4176231" >best camera apps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you can download.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1975636">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1975636.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1975636">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1975636.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1975636%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1975636/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Battery-All-day-usage"><a href="#Battery-All-day-usage" class="headerlink" title="Battery: All-day usage"></a><strong>Battery: All-day usage</strong></h2><p> This is an all-day device, and should last you roughly around 10 hours of regular use, as per our testing. We spent almost a full working day pushing it using Split View to draft articles, with some Procreate drawing and Netflix streaming in between, and the iPad Pro clocked out at around 9 hours. However, we found some apps like Google Docs drain the battery more than most, so it varies depending on your workflow. Much like the Apple Watch, if you’re not a power user this tablet could last you a number of days before needing a fresh charge.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Q4zUu4bRCg_V0xhMi5Yh7Ns7znc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_4-bef539783bbd48ae98e1becea11ce4dc.jpg"                      alt="IPad Pro 11 Inch"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983588">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983588.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983588">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983588.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983588%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983588/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Software-The-best-yet"><a href="#Software-The-best-yet" class="headerlink" title="Software: The best yet"></a><strong>Software: The best yet</strong></h2><p> This is interesting because iOS 12 is by far and away the best version of the operating system yet, but there are still some blatant compromises that eat away at the possibility of the iPad Pro being a laptop replacement. You can’t just unzip files. And moving photos or documents between programs, even cloud-storage services like Google Drive and Dropbox, is a nightmare. In most cases, it’s actually doable if you find the right app, but it’s always far too much busy work when its a very simple five-second solution on any laptop. This wasted time adds up, and iOS 12 starts to get in the way of the iPad Pro’s potential.</p><p> Due to the particular size of the screen, developers have to update all of their apps to fit properly on the iPad Pro, but even months after its release there are many apps that throw up horrible black bars between the software and the device bezel. Snapchat and Instagram are mostly unusable too, unless you’re willing to compromise with a downscaled, emulated version of the iPhone app.</p><p> iOS 12 is by far and away the best version of the operating system yet, but there are still some blatant compromises that eat away at the possibility of the iPad Pro being a laptop replacement.</p><h2 id="Price-Well-worth-the-money-if-you-can-justify-it"><a href="#Price-Well-worth-the-money-if-you-can-justify-it" class="headerlink" title="Price: Well worth the money if you can justify it"></a><strong>Price: Well worth the money if you can justify it</strong></h2><p> As far as tablets go, one of the main reasons many people are put off by the iPad Pro is the existence of far cheaper options. Our review model (11-inch, 64GB) retails for $799, and you may well be inclined to upgrade both the size and the capacity to suit your needs. This doesn’t factor in some of the more essential accessories with jaw-dropping prices like the Apple Pencil, Smart Keyboard, and the Bluetooth headphones necessary to navigate the lack of a headphone jack. That can lead to a very expensive purchase, and with Apple products, it can be hard to tell whether they are worth it case by case.</p><p> Luckily, the 11-inch iPad Pro is such a revolutionary upgrade on most tablets that you do truly get what you pay for here. The A12X Bionic puts it leagues ahead of the competition, making it the most powerful productivity machine for professional creatives on the market. There is nothing really competing at this price range beyond.</p><h2 id="Competition-Hard-to-beat"><a href="#Competition-Hard-to-beat" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Hard to beat"></a><strong>Competition: Hard to beat</strong></h2><p> Nothing can really compete as far as power is concerned when it comes to the iPad Pro, so you’re mostly looking at compromises with certain benefits. The Samsung Galaxy Tab S4 doesn’t suffer from the same locked off functionality of iOS 12 with its Android architecture and has a better AMOLED screen. It also comes packaged with a stylus, which mitigates some of the cost of the Apple Pencil if you find a stylus necessary. This device retails at $649.99, making it more affordable than the iPad. The Microsoft Surface Pro 6 is another option, and may be a better fit for replacing your laptop than the iPad, with its fully functional Windows 10 OS, but it’s still costly at $799. You could always roll back to the early 2018 9.7-inch iPad if you want to save some money. This will set you back $329 and cover most of your bases, but you’ll miss out on updates like Face ID, the sleek new design, and accessories.</p><p> Interested in reading more reviews?

However, Snapchat marketing can be challenging, as the platform constantly evolves and changes.</p><p>This article provides an overview of <strong>Snapchat marketing strategy,</strong> including why businesses should market on this platform, what types of content to post, and how to measure results.</p><p>With the information available in this article, you will be able to create a strategy that works for your business and get succeeded.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/snapchat-app.jpg"                      alt="snapchat app"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Snapchat-Overview"><a href="#Part-1-Snapchat-Overview" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Snapchat Overview"></a>Part 1. Snapchat Overview</h2><p>Firstly, let’s have an overview of Snapchat before we see how to draw your blueprint in Part 3 and Part 4.</p><p>Snapchat - founded by Evan Spiegel, Bobby Murphy, and Reggie Brown - is a unique messaging app because it allows users to send disappearing messages and photos. This feature has made the app popular with young people aged 13-34 who want to communicate without leaving a permanent record.</p><p>As of May 2022, Snapchat has <a class="link"   href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/545967/snapchat-app-dau/#:~:text=How%20many%20daily%20active%20users,increase%20of%20over%2018%20percent." >347 million daily active users. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> That’s impressive growth from its humble beginnings back in 2011. With <a class="link"   href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/272014/global-social-networks-ranked-by-number-of-users/" >monthly active users of 557 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, Snapchat is ranked as the 12th most popular social media platform.</p><p>Not only that, the number of <a class="link"   href="https://www.omnicoreagency.com/snapchat-statistics/" >Snapchat daily video views is 18 billion, <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> making it the best platform to showcase your services&#x2F;products and generate more income. However, all this is only possible with the right <strong>Snapchat marketing strategy.</strong></p><h2 id="Part-2-Why-Should-Business-Market-On-Snapchat"><a href="#Part-2-Why-Should-Business-Market-On-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Why Should Business Market On Snapchat"></a>Part 2. Why Should Business Market On Snapchat</h2><p>So you are probably thinking why your business should be on Snapchat - because it’s popular with teenagers and young adults. In fact, the platform has over 347 million daily active users, with <strong>75%</strong> being under the age of 34.</p><p>Therefore, if you’re targeting a younger demographic, then Snapchat should definitely be part of your social media marketing strategy.</p><p>Another big reason is that Snapchat is incredibly engaging. The average Snapchat user opens the app at least 20 times a day and spends 25 - 30 minutes on the app each day, so that’s a lot of potential exposure for your business.</p><p>Not only that, but since Snapchat is still a new field and opened up <a class="link"   href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/20/snapchat-messaging-app-ad-creepy-ouija" >ads to users in October 2014, <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> many big companies have not entered the market. This has created a huge opportunity for small businesses to market their products and generate leads to increase their sales.</p><p>With Snapchat, you can get discovered by users in their Discovery feeds or via Stories. Also, they can interact with your brand using the Geofilters, stickers, and lenses you’ve produced during your ad campaign.</p><p>For instance, Taco Bell created a filter for Cinco de Mayo. The filter received 224 Million views, which is insane. Nevertheless, this campaign kept users engaged and helped increase Taco Bell’s sales.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/taco-bell-cinco-de-mayo-filter-on-snapchat.jpg"                      alt="taco bell cinco de mayo filter on snapchat"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Where-To-Start-Your-Snapchat-Marketing-Strategy"><a href="#Part-3-Where-To-Start-Your-Snapchat-Marketing-Strategy" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

They can be up to 24 hours long, and are viewable an unlimited number of times within that time frame.</p><p>You can create a Snapchat Story by taking a series of snaps and adding text, filters, and other effects to make the content more engaging and share it with your followers or make it public afterward.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/snapchat-stories.jpg"                      alt="snapchat stories"                ></p><p>Here are a few tips and approaches to help you create a Snapchat story that will capture your audience’s attention:</p><ul><li><strong>Keep it short and sweet:</strong> Snapchat stories are only 10 seconds long, so make sure your story is concise and to the point.</li><li><strong>Use high-quality visuals:</strong> Since Snapchat is all about visuals, use high-quality images and videos in your story.</li><li><strong>Be creative</strong>: Use Snapchat’s unique features, such as filters and augmented reality, to create a story that is truly one of a kind.</li></ul><h3 id="How-To-Advertise-With-Snapchat"><a href="#How-To-Advertise-With-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="How To Advertise With Snapchat"></a>How To Advertise With Snapchat</h3><p>Snapchat Ads are a form of advertisement that allows businesses to reach out to Snapchat users with creative and interactive content.

Ideas To Create And Send Snaps Quickly</h3><p>Below are some tips&#x2F;ideas to help you quickly create and send Snaps to keep your Snapchat streak alive:</p><p><strong>Idea 1. Edit Blank Snap And Send As New Snap</strong></p><p>If you have run out of snap ideas, don’t worry about sending a high-quality one. No one is judging you, so send a blank snap to keep the streak alive; however, edit it a little so it looks like you have put in some effort.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/sending-a-blank-screen-to-keep-streak-alive.jpg"                      alt="sending a blank screen to keep streak alive"                ></p><p><strong>Idea 2. Send Black Screen</strong></p><p>Your Snapstreaks are about to expire, and you’re freaking out? Here’s a little hack that will keep them alive: send a black screen snap. That’s right! You can also add some doodles or stickers to the picture to make things look more interesting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/sending-blank-screen-as-snap.jpg"                      alt="sending blank screen as snap"                ></p><p><strong>Idea 3.

Simply open up the Snapchat app, click a picture, and tap on the emoji icon to select the emoji or Bitmoji that you want to add to your Snap. You can even resize and move them around to get it just right.</p><p><strong>Idea 4. Snap With Your Pets</strong></p><p>We all love our pets - and we also like staying connected with our friends on Snapchat. So why not combine the two? Occasionally take a picture of your pet using the app and send it to your besties to make their day and keep the streak alive!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/snap-with-pet-to-maintain-streak.jpg"                      alt="snap with pet to maintain streak"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137225/26400" target="_top" id="2137225">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137225" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137225/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Idea 5.

Seize Occasions And Keep Your Snapchat Sneak Alive"></a>Tip 2. Seize Occasions And Keep Your Snapchat Sneak Alive</h3><p>To keep your Snapchat streak alive, try to seize any opportunity you can to take pictures and send them to friends. Below are some ideas to do this:</p><p><strong>Idea 1. The First Day Matters</strong></p><p>Many people choose to start their streaks on special days because it helps them remember to keep them alive. For example, if you start your streak on your birthday, you’ll always remember to keep the streak going on, and it will also help you to grab the attention of people.</p><p><strong>Idea 2. Memorable Day</strong></p><p>We all have memorable days in our lives, like a milestone, graduation, or special event that we want to remember forever. What is a better way to commemorate them than with a Snap? Your friends and family will appreciate it, and you will be able to keep your streak alive for days to come.</p><p><strong>Idea 3. Streak While Traveling</strong></p><p>Whenever you are on a trip, travel to your office&#x2F;college, or head out to run some errands, remember to take a picture of the surroundings that look interesting and send it to whom you are establishing the streak.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/send-snapstreak-while-traveling.jpg"                      alt="send snapstreak while traveling"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-3-Organize-Your-Snapchat-And-Your-Time"><a href="#Tip-3-Organize-Your-Snapchat-And-Your-Time" class="headerlink" title="Tip 3. Organize Your Snapchat And Your Time"></a>Tip 3. Organize Your Snapchat And Your Time</h3><p>Are you trying to get the most out of Snapchat without letting it take over your life? Below we’ve provided some ideas to help you organize your time and your snaps.</p><p><strong>Idea 1. Edit the Name of your Snapchat Friends</strong></p><p>To avoid losing your Snapchat streaks with any of your contacts, you should start editing their names. Snapchat lists your most contacted friends at the top, so you might not see the others who are lower on your list. Editing their names to include something that will help you search for them will make it easier to avoid forgetting to send them a snap regularly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/edit-the-name-of-your-snapchat-friend.jpg"                      alt="edit the name of your snapchat friend"                ></p><p><strong>Idea 2. Pin Your Conversations</strong></p><p>If you want to keep someone at the top of your chat list, consider pinning their chat. This will also ultimately help you send snaps to them without breaking the streak.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/pin-conversation-in-snapchat.jpg"                      alt="pin conversation in snapchat"                ></p><p><strong>Idea 3. Stick to a Particular Time of the Day</strong></p><p>You will gain more by starting your Snapstreaks later on in the day, especially if you are only sending one snap per day. This way, the hourglass emoji will be visible for a considerable amount of time before it expires.</p><p><strong>Idea 4. Check Your Filters</strong></p><p>If you’re trying to keep up with multiple Snapstreaks at once, it’s easy to forget who you’re on a streak with. But there’s a way to see them without going to your list of friends.</p><p>Whenever you’re about to send a new snap, swipe through the filters. Here, you’ll see a special Snapchat streak filter, which will show how many consecutive days of successful streak you have in big white numbers next to the fire emoji.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>In this article, we’ve compiled a list of fun and creative <strong>Snapchat streak ideas</strong> to help you stay connected with your friends.</p><p>Hopefully, by following these tips, you can now keep your Snapchat streak alive and stay connected with your contacts in a better and more engaging way!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><h2 id="Gain-Recovery-of-Personal-Snapshots"><a href="#Gain-Recovery-of-Personal-Snapshots" class="headerlink" title="Gain Recovery of Personal Snapshots"></a>Gain Recovery of Personal Snapshots</h2><p>Have you ever set some of your Snapchat pictures to “My Eyes Only” and then accidentally deleted them?

In this section, you can learn <strong>how to send snaps from the camera roll</strong> without capturing a live snap. For this, we will explain some manual methods as well as some reliable apps in a detailed manner.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Using-a-Snapchat-Filter"><a href="#Method-1-Using-a-Snapchat-Filter" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Using a Snapchat Filter"></a>Method 1: Using a Snapchat Filter</h3><p>Snapchat allows you to apply its filters on any of your camera roll’s pictures. By selecting a particular photo or video from your memories or snap, you can instantly add a filter to them. Afterward, you can send the filtered image to your friends as a regular snap. However, this solution has a significant drawback that you must know. The limitation is that the receiver of the snap would be able to see that the sent picture is from the camera roll.</p><p>Step1 Open your Snapchat and swipe up to open the ‘Memories’. Go to your Camera Roll and select any particular picture from there.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/send-snaps-from-camera-roll-1.jpg"                      alt="access camera roll tab"                ></p><p>Step2 After choosing a particular photo, tap on the “<strong>Edit</strong>“ icon at the bottom left corner. You can apply filters to the photo by swiping from right to left.

Though, to rival other apps like Instagram and TikTok, Snapchat has recently added a “Sound” feature. With this newly-added option, users can add music to a Snapchat video pretty easily and make their snaps more interesting. In this post, I’m going to let you know how to add music to a Snapchat video without any hassle. Let’s get it started and level-up your Snapchat game!</p><h2 id="Part-1-What’s-the-Sound-Feature-in-Snapchat"><a href="#Part-1-What’s-the-Sound-Feature-in-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What’s the Sound Feature in Snapchat?"></a>Part 1: What’s the Sound Feature in Snapchat?</h2><p>Before we learn how to add music to your Snapchat video, let’s quickly get to know about the “Sounds” feature of the app. If you have been using Instagram or TikTok, then you might be familiar with their music feature.</p><p>Similarly, in 2020, Snapchat has also included a Sound feature that lets us add music to our snaps (photos or videos). For this, you can integrate Snapchat with a streaming service like Spotify, Pandora, Apple Music, or Soundcloud. While it doesn’t include all sorts of tracks, you can find most of the popular songs so that you can easily add music to a Snapchat video and make it interesting.</p><p>Once the other person would view your snap, they can hear the music playing in the background. If they want to listen to it or know more about the song, then they can just tap on its sticker on your snap.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Add-Music-to-a-Snapchat-Video-on-iPhone-or-Android"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Add-Music-to-a-Snapchat-Video-on-iPhone-or-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Add Music to a Snapchat Video on iPhone or Android?"></a>Part 2: How to Add Music to a Snapchat Video on iPhone or Android?</h2><p>One of the best things about Snapchat is that the overall interface of the app is pretty similar for both iOS and Android versions. Therefore, to learn how to add music on a Snapchat video, you need to follow the same process. As of now, you can find almost all the popular songs on Snapchat and can even record your own sounds.</p><p>To learn how to add music to your Snapchat video on your Android or iOS device, you can just follow this simple drill.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Visit the Snapchat Sound section on the app</strong></p><p>At first, just launch the Snapchat application on your device and tap on the camera icon from the home to start recording.</p><p>Using the rear or front camera of your device, you can now record any video on Snapchat. Once the video is recorded, you can tap on the music icon from the sidebar to add a song to a Snapchat video.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Search for any music to include in your Snaps</strong></p><p>As you would tap on the <strong>Music</strong> icon, you can view a list of various songs supported by Snapchat. If you want to look for anything specific, then just tap on the search icon and enter keywords to find a song of your choice.</p><p>Afterward, Snapchat will list the searched results, and you can tap on the play icon to first listen to the song. Just tap on the icon of the song and click on the “Next” button from the bottom to include it in the snap.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Trim and add the song to your Snapchat video</strong></p><p>Now, Snapchat will automatically display the snippet of the music at the bottom. You can use the left or the right slider option to trim the section of the music you want to add. Here, you also can tap on the play icon to listen to the track first.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Add music to your Snapchat video after recording</strong></p><p>That’s it! Once you have trimmed the music snippet, you can post it. You can tap on the shutter or the download icon first to save the video on your phone.</p><p>Now, you can preview the music via its sticker. You can just tap on the music sticker to change its appearance or drag it on the screen to place it anywhere you like. To change its size, you can just pinch-in or pinch-out the sticker.</p><p>In the end, just tap on the send icon to post your snap. You can add it to your story or sent it to any Snapchat contact. When they would open it, they can listen to the added song and even tap on the sticker to load it.</p><p>In this way, anyone can learn how to put music on a Snapchat video without any hassle.</p><h2 id="Part-3-FAQs-on-Adding-Music-to-a-Snapchat-Video"><a href="#Part-3-FAQs-on-Adding-Music-to-a-Snapchat-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: FAQs on Adding Music to a Snapchat Video"></a>Part 3: FAQs on Adding Music to a Snapchat Video</h2><p>Now when you know how to add music to your Snapchat video, let’s clear some common doubts related to it.</p><ul><li><strong>How to add your own music to a Snapchat video?</strong></li></ul><p>Apart from the available songs on Snapchat, the app also lets us add the sound of our choice. For this, just click on the music icon and tap the “Create Sound” button instead. This will let you record anything or create your own music on Snapchat.</p><ul><li><strong>Why are some songs not available on Snapchat?</strong></li></ul><p>The Sound feature of Snapchat only provides licensed music by collaborating with some of the biggest record labels. Therefore, while you can find most of the popular songs, chances are that some of them might be missing from the collection.</p><ul><li><strong>Why can’t I add music to my Snapchat videos?</strong></li></ul><p>Well, there could be two possible reasons for this – you might be using an old version of Snapchat or the feature might not be available in your region yet. To fix this, you can just go to the Snapchat page on the App&#x2F;Play Store and tap on the “Update” button. Furthermore, if the Sound feature has not been rolled out to your region, then you can just wait for a while.</p><p>As you can see, it is pretty easy to learn how to add music to a Snapchat video like a pro. With the newly-added Sounds feature, it is pretty easy to add a song to your Snapchat videos and make them more interesting. Go ahead and try this feature to make your snaps creative and share this guide with others to teach them how do you add music to a Snapchat video as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Ollie Mattison</p><p>Ollie Mattison is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Ollie Mattison</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-pixelpioneer-screensaver-logging/"><u>[New] In 2024, PixelPioneer Screensaver Logging</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/new-tiktok-and-snapchat-face-off-a-users-perspective-guide/"><u>[New] TikTok & Snapchat Face-Off A User's Perspective Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-discover-the-hottest-snapchat-tips-for-todays-trends/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Discover the Hottest Snapchat Tips for Today's Trends</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-elevate-your-reels-add-sound-for-impactful-storytelling/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Elevate Your Reels Add Sound for Impactful Storytelling</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-inside-outlook-on-vr-good-and-bad-aspects/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Inside Outlook on VR Good & Bad Aspects</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-from-novice-to-pro-a-compreenhensive-guide-to-gifs-in-snapchat/"><u>[Updated] From Novice to Pro A Compreenhensive Guide to Gifs in Snapchat</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-keep-up-the-pace-in-snapchat-streaks-with-these-tips/"><u>[Updated] Keep Up the Pace in Snapchat Streaks with These Tips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-snapchat-innovation-hub-explore-over-120-creative-title-concepts-to-personalize-your-storytelling/"><u>[Updated] Snapchat Innovation Hub Explore over 120 Creative Title Concepts to Personalize Your Storytelling</u></a></li><li><a href="https://bypass-frp.techidaily.com/how-to-bypass-frp-from-tecno-spark-10c-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Bypass FRP from Tecno Spark 10C?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/how-to-track-oneplus-ace-3-location-without-installing-software-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Track OnePlus Ace 3 Location without Installing Software? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/retro-reality-on-snapchat-effortless-video-reversal-for-2024/"><u>Retro Reality on Snapchat Effortless Video Reversal for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://common-error.techidaily.com/troubleshooting-the-non-functional-astro-a40-mic-step-by-step-guide-to-a-fix/"><u>Troubleshooting the Non-Functional Astro A40 Mic - Step by Step Guide to a Fix</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/unlock-oneplus-nord-3-5g-phone-password-without-factory-reset-full-guide-here-by-drfone-android/"><u>Unlock OnePlus Nord 3 5G Phone Password Without Factory Reset Full Guide Here</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137216/26400" target="_top" id="2137216">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137216" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137216/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>

This self-deleting feature deters users from <strong>saving Snapchat videos</strong> of their friends. Snapchat photos, videos, and stories of contacts vanish from storyboard right after you view them.</p><p> So, what will you do to save photos or videos from your friends’ Snapchat or Snap Stories long before they are gone? You can take a screenshot, save in flight mode, use your computer, or an app to capture the videos and images.</p><p> Through this article, we are going to tell you, how to save Snapchats to your phone to make you watch them later.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1"><strong>Part1: How to Save Snapchats without them knowing</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part2"><strong>Part2: How to save Snapchat videos on Mac</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part3"><strong>Part3: How to save Snapchat videos on Android</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part4"><strong>Part4: How to save Snapchat videos to your Phone</strong></a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Save-Snapchats-without-them-knowing"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Save-Snapchats-without-them-knowing" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Save Snapchats without them knowing"></a>Part 1: How to Save Snapchats without them knowing</h2><p> You want to save a friend’s Snaps, but Snapchat immediately alerts them of the screen shot taken. Hence, it is not possible to save other’s pictures or videos in Snapchat in incognito mode. You don’t need apps to save Snapchat to your phone. There is hardly a feasible way to do so without the senders’ knowledge. In such a situation, you can try out the following option – saving Snaps in flight mode.</p><p> Here are the steps</p><ol><li>First of all, launch the Snapchat app on your mobile phone and leave it open. Go to your phone’s ‘Settings’ (Android&#x2F;iPhone) and toggle on the ‘Airplane&#x2F;Flight’ mode. Airplane&#x2F;Flight mode disables all the wireless connections, be it network signals or internet related services for your device (Wi-Fi as well as cellular).</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snapchat-save-without-knowing.JPG"                      alt="snapchat save without knowing"                ></p><ol start="2"><li>Browse the Snapchat inbox and view the desired Snap that you wish to save, and quickly take a screenshot. Make sure to be quick enough and do it before the Snap expires.</li><li>Now, logout from your Snapchat account right after taking the screenshot. You need to follow the logout process according to your device specific settings. Being in ‘Airplane&#x2F;Flight’ mode you can’t logout, but click the logout option anyway (this is vital!).</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snapchat-log-out.JPG"                      alt="snapchat log out"                ></p><ol start="4"><li>Here, you need to close the Snapchat app on your mobile phone by swiping out the Snapchat app (up&#x2F;sideways depending on Android&#x2F;iPhone) from your device’s force quit screen.</li><li>Toggle off the ‘Airplane&#x2F;Flight’ mode and wait until your phone connects to the Wi-Fi or mobile network. Now, launch the Snapchat app again and login with the same credentials. The Snaps you have taken screenshots of will still appear as unopened on the storyboard and your friend will have no clue about the Snap being screenshot.</li></ol><p> <strong>Read More to Get :</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Screenshot on Snapchat without Them Knowing &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-save-Snapchat-videos-on-Mac"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-save-Snapchat-videos-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to save Snapchat videos on Mac"></a>Part 2: How to save Snapchat videos on Mac</h2><p> After learning to take screenshots of Snaps using the ‘Airplane’ mode, how about saving Snapchat videos on your Mac computer? Yes, you can easily save Snapchat videos using your iPhone and Mac computer. The process involves recording your iPhone’s screen through your Mac as a movie and then saving it. Here is how to do it</p><ol><li>Take and connect your iPhone and Mac computer using a lightning cable. Make sure that they are pre-synced. Now, launch QuickTime Player on your computer and then tap ‘File’ in the finder menu, then ‘New Movie Recording’.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snapchat-quiktime.JPG"                      alt="snapchat quicktime"                ></p><ol start="2"><li>This will make your Mac’s camera act as the primary camera&#x2F;recording device. To turn the iPhone as the recording device, go to the QuickTime screen and tap the ‘downward arrow’ button adjacent to the record button. The iPhone will be available under both the Camera and Microphone section, choose it for both the options.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snapchat-record.JPG"                      alt="snapchat record"                ></p><ol start="3"><li>You’ll now notice that your iPhone’s screen has been mirrored with your Mac computer.</li><li>Now, on your iPhone, go to Snapchat and browse the inbox. Subsequently, on your Mac, tap the ‘Record’ button and then start viewing the snaps on your iPhone. QuickTime will record everything from the snaps and save it on your computer.</li><li>After you’re done with recording, tap the ‘Record’ button again to stop it. Lastly, go to ‘File’ and click ‘Save’, the file format to which the file will be saved is .mov which is generally supported by majority of movie players.</li></ol><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-save-Snapchat-videos-on-Android"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-save-Snapchat-videos-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to save Snapchat videos on Android"></a>Part 3: How to save Snapchat videos on Android</h2><p> In case you are looking for a way to save Snapchat videos, take screenshots of chats, make slideshows of stories, or record other’s stories on your Android device itself, then AZ Screen recorder is one such app to save those Snapchats. It doesn’t require any root access to your Android phone, so is preferred by most users.</p><p> Step-by-step Tutorial</p><ol><li>Download the Apk file, install, and launch the AZ Screen Recorder Snapchat App. Set up the account in your Android phone with required information.</li><li>Tap the ‘Record’ button in AZ Screen Recorder and then open Snapchat inbox.

Thereby, you save the Snapchat stories without even notifying the uploader.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-save-Snapchat-videos-to-your-Phone"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-save-Snapchat-videos-to-your-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to save Snapchat videos to your Phone"></a>Part 4: How to save Snapchat videos to your Phone</h2><p> If you are wondering about saving your own Snapchat videos to your phone, then you are at the right place for a solution.

Choosing Creative Topics for Snapchat Video</h2><p>On the top of that, we will start with coming up with creative ideas for your Snapchat videos. If you’re struggling to develop <strong>ideas to post on Snapchat</strong>, don’t worry - we’ve got you covered.</p><p>Below we’ve provided some tips for your Snapchat videos:</p><h3 id="Idea-1-Conduct-Interviews-Via-Snaps"><a href="#Idea-1-Conduct-Interviews-Via-Snaps" class="headerlink" title="Idea 1. Conduct Interviews Via Snaps"></a>Idea 1. Conduct Interviews Via Snaps</h3><p>If you are running your Snapchat like a YouTube channel, conducting interviews on Snapchat is a perfect way to get quick, candid responses from your interviewees. To make it more fun, captivating, and engaging, you can also use captivating Snaps to add a personal touch.</p><p>All you need is: set lighting and sound, a 10-second snap with a question on it, and the interviewee. Start by introducing the person in the frame, put the snap on the screen, and let the interviewee answer your question.</p><p>To make things interesting, add <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >filters <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, stickers, or <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >lenses <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to reflect the scenarios or your personality.

Host A YouTube And Snapchat Q&amp;A"></a>Idea 2. Host A YouTube And Snapchat Q&amp;A</h3><p>Another great idea is to host a YouTube and Snapchat Q&amp;A. You can film with a famous snap chatter or YouTuber and ask them a few questions. You can also ask your followers&#x2F;audience to send their questions via text message or response to your stories. This will help you get your viewers involved with your content and increase engagement.</p><p>To make sure your snap Q&amp;A goes off without a hitch, be sure to:</p><ul><li>Set up your Snapchat settings of <strong>“Who Can Contact Me”</strong> to <strong>“Everyone”</strong> for a while to allow for questions.</li><li>During the session, try to acknowledge who asked the question.</li><li>After the session, change the “<strong>Who Can Contact Me”</strong> setting back to <strong>only friends</strong> to avoid spam overload.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/snapchat-qa-session-via-stories.jpg"                      alt="snapchat q a session via stories"                ></p><h3 id="Idea-3-Fun-Tidbits"><a href="#Idea-3-Fun-Tidbits" class="headerlink" title="Idea 3. Fun Tidbits"></a>Idea 3. Fun Tidbits</h3><p>Snapchat is an excellent platform to get your audience engaged with your brand by creating fun tidbits to get more traffic.</p><p>You can create short videos or images designed to be entertaining and informative. For example, Amazon’s Snapchat posts stories of their employees carving pumpkins and posting them to their followers. This is a creative and fun solution to reach new customers and create a brand personality.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/amazon-tidbit-on-snapchat.jpg"                      alt="amazon tidbit on snapchat"                ></p><h3 id="Idea-4-Behind-The-Scenes-Footage"><a href="#Idea-4-Behind-The-Scenes-Footage" class="headerlink" title="Idea 4.

Create Title Cards For Longer Snapchat Stories"></a>Idea 1. Create Title Cards For Longer Snapchat Stories</h3><p>If you’re creating a Snapchat story that is longer than the standard 10 seconds, you can use title cards to help keep your viewers engaged.</p><p>Title cards are simply images with the text you can insert into your story to help identify what’s coming next. For example, if you’re sharing a story about your company’s history, you could use a title card at the beginning of each section to identify the different parts of the story.</p><p>For this, you can take a snap of a wall or perhaps block your camera to get a black screen and then paste your text on the picture. You can also play with the font size, style, or color to create engaging title cards.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/title-cards-for-snapchat-stories.jpg"                      alt="title cards for snapchat stories"                ></p><h3 id="Idea-2-Adding-Music-To-Your-Video"><a href="#Idea-2-Adding-Music-To-Your-Video" class="headerlink" title="Idea 2.
