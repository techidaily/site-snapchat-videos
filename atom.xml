From there, proceed to the “Settings” by tapping on the gear icon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/back-up-camera-roll-to-snapchat-5.jpg"                      alt="open snapchat settings"                ></p><p>Step2 Scroll down a little to find the option “Memories.” Afterward, you can see the option “Backup Progress.” If you can see the word “Complete,” it means that your Memories are backed up completely.

Streak While Traveling</strong></p><p>Whenever you are on a trip, travel to your office&#x2F;college, or head out to run some errands, remember to take a picture of the surroundings that look interesting and send it to whom you are establishing the streak.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/send-snapstreak-while-traveling.jpg"                      alt="send snapstreak while traveling"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-3-Organize-Your-Snapchat-And-Your-Time"><a href="#Tip-3-Organize-Your-Snapchat-And-Your-Time" class="headerlink" title="Tip 3. Organize Your Snapchat And Your Time"></a>Tip 3. Organize Your Snapchat And Your Time</h3><p>Are you trying to get the most out of Snapchat without letting it take over your life? Below we’ve provided some ideas to help you organize your time and your snaps.</p><p><strong>Idea 1. Edit the Name of your Snapchat Friends</strong></p><p>To avoid losing your Snapchat streaks with any of your contacts, you should start editing their names. Snapchat lists your most contacted friends at the top, so you might not see the others who are lower on your list. Editing their names to include something that will help you search for them will make it easier to avoid forgetting to send them a snap regularly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/edit-the-name-of-your-snapchat-friend.jpg"                      alt="edit the name of your snapchat friend"                ></p><p><strong>Idea 2. Pin Your Conversations</strong></p><p>If you want to keep someone at the top of your chat list, consider pinning their chat. This will also ultimately help you send snaps to them without breaking the streak.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/pin-conversation-in-snapchat.jpg"                      alt="pin conversation in snapchat"                ></p><p><strong>Idea 3. Stick to a Particular Time of the Day</strong></p><p>You will gain more by starting your Snapstreaks later on in the day, especially if you are only sending one snap per day. This way, the hourglass emoji will be visible for a considerable amount of time before it expires.</p><p><strong>Idea 4.

In this era of digitalization, one can easily interact with friends on social media. With the emergence of social media, it has now become convenient to maintain social connections and support networks that otherwise wouldn’t have been possible. Social networking platforms have made staying connected with friends, family, and other acquaintances easier than ever.</p><p>Snapchat is one such platform that has gained immense popularity over recent years. A multimedia messaging app, it allows you to share pictures and videos with your friends and dear ones. The app lets you take snaps and apply filters and lenses to best express yourself. You can use the <strong>best Snapchat filters</strong> and lenses to add personality and whimsy to snaps.</p><p>Whether you want to have some fun with your friends or want to impress someone, Snapchat has amazing effects for every occasion. Indeed, Instagram’s story highlights have become one of the biggest social media platforms. However, by the end of June 2021, Snapchat claimed to have increased its global daily active users to 293 million.</p><p>Snapchat’s lenses and filters have become so famous that Instagram has mimicked the feature. But, there’s a reason why snaps are regularly circulating outside Snapchat - the fantastic creative effects give it a leg up over Instagram. Snapchat’s extensive collection of funny lenses, cool filters, and stunning beauty filters makes it way better than Instagram’s.</p><p>Wondering how to find good face modifiers from a sea of clones out there? Relax! Our team at Wondershare has done the hard work and made a list of the best filters and lenses on Snapchat. But, first, let’s have a detailed insight into the best Snapchat filters and lenses.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What Are the Differences Between Snapchat Filters and Lenses?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: 20 Best Filters &amp; Lenses On Snapchat to Use in 2021</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: FAQs About Snapchat Filters &amp; Lenses</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-What-Are-the-Differences-Between-Snapchat-Filters-and-Lenses"><a href="#Part-1-What-Are-the-Differences-Between-Snapchat-Filters-and-Lenses" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Are the Differences Between Snapchat Filters and Lenses?"></a>Part 1: What Are the Differences Between Snapchat Filters and Lenses?</h2><p>Snapchat filters are static overlays and sit on the top of your photo or video. In contrast, Snapchat lenses are dynamic, augmented reality animations that alter your voice along with your appearance as you move on the screen. Unlike filters that are added after taking a photo, lenses are displayed while you’re taking the photo.</p><p>The best filters on Snapchat let you change a snap’s tint or change the direction or speed in which your video is played back. On the other hand, Snapchat lenses work by utilizing facial recognition software to track your features and apply an animation that follows your facial movements. While lenses can change the sound of your voice and the appearance of your face, filters can only add color tones, messages, customized images, and icons to your snaps.</p><p>The photo and video sharing app allow you to make your own filters and lenses. Creating a filter on Snapchat isn’t free as you will have to pay a certain amount based on the filter’s square foot. However, when it comes to making your own Snapchat lens, you won’t have to pay any fees as the entire process is free.</p><h2 id="Part-2-20-Best-Filters-Lenses-On-Snapchat-to-Use-in-2021"><a href="#Part-2-20-Best-Filters-Lenses-On-Snapchat-to-Use-in-2021" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 20 Best Filters &amp; Lenses On Snapchat to Use in 2021"></a>Part 2: 20 Best Filters &amp; Lenses On Snapchat to Use in 2021</h2><h3 id="Best-Snapchat-Filters-For-Selfies"><a href="#Best-Snapchat-Filters-For-Selfies" class="headerlink" title="Best Snapchat Filters For Selfies"></a>Best Snapchat Filters For Selfies</h3><p>Getting bored with the regular filters that add some brightness and little symbols to selfies?

These unique features offered on Snapchat are a contributing factor to its popularity.</p><p>Using Snapchat, you can not only take ordinary snaps but can also create boomerangs. The bounce feature on Snapchat was first introduced in August 2018 on all iOS devices. This feature is similar to the boomerang option available on Instagram. Through this feature, people can play their captured snap on the loop, highlighting a specific action in it. For your convenience, this article will tell <strong>how to do a boomerang on Snapchat</strong> in multiple ways.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Make-a-Bounce-on-Snapchat-for-iOS"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Make-a-Bounce-on-Snapchat-for-iOS" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Make a Bounce on Snapchat - for iOS"></a>Part 1: How to Make a Bounce on Snapchat - for iOS</h2><p>If you are not an Instagram user, you can still make boomerangs using Snapchat. However, you must update your Snapchat to its latest version to use the bounce feature. To update your Snapchat and learn <strong>how to do a boomerang on Snapchat</strong>, follow the below steps:</p><p>Step1 On your iOS device, navigate to the App Store. You then need to click on your “Profile” icon displayed in the top-right corner.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-do-a-boomerang-on-snapchat-1.jpg"                      alt="tap on the profile icon"                ></p><p>Step2 After tapping on the Profile icon, you can see all the pending updates of your installed apps.

To make a bounce, open your Snapchat and hit the “Record” button to capture a video. Once you have recorded the video, tap on the “Arrow” icon displayed at the bottom of the right section. Keep tapping that icon until you can see the “<strong>Bounce</strong>“ option. Now set the time duration of your video and tap on the “Save” button to conclude.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-do-a-boomerang-on-snapchat-3.jpg"                      alt="enable the bounce feature"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Alternatives-of-Bounce-on-Snapchat-for-both-iOS-and-Android"><a href="#Part-2-Alternatives-of-Bounce-on-Snapchat-for-both-iOS-and-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Alternatives of Bounce on Snapchat - for both iOS and Android"></a>Part 2: Alternatives of Bounce on Snapchat - for both iOS and Android</h2><p>The Bounce feature is only available on iOS devices.

Edit Blank Snap And Send As New Snap</strong></p><p>If you have run out of snap ideas, don’t worry about sending a high-quality one. No one is judging you, so send a blank snap to keep the streak alive; however, edit it a little so it looks like you have put in some effort.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/sending-a-blank-screen-to-keep-streak-alive.jpg"                      alt="sending a blank screen to keep streak alive"                ></p><p><strong>Idea 2. Send Black Screen</strong></p><p>Your Snapstreaks are about to expire, and you’re freaking out? Here’s a little hack that will keep them alive: send a black screen snap. That’s right! You can also add some doodles or stickers to the picture to make things look more interesting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/sending-blank-screen-as-snap.jpg"                      alt="sending blank screen as snap"                ></p><p><strong>Idea 3. Use Emojis And Bitmojis</strong></p><p>You can also add emojis or Bitmojis to your photos to make them look more interesting and fun. Simply open up the Snapchat app, click a picture, and tap on the emoji icon to select the emoji or Bitmoji that you want to add to your Snap. You can even resize and move them around to get it just right.</p><p><strong>Idea 4. Snap With Your Pets</strong></p><p>We all love our pets - and we also like staying connected with our friends on Snapchat. So why not combine the two?

Organize Your Snapchat And Your Time"></a>Tip 3. Organize Your Snapchat And Your Time</h3><p>Are you trying to get the most out of Snapchat without letting it take over your life? Below we’ve provided some ideas to help you organize your time and your snaps.</p><p><strong>Idea 1. Edit the Name of your Snapchat Friends</strong></p><p>To avoid losing your Snapchat streaks with any of your contacts, you should start editing their names. Snapchat lists your most contacted friends at the top, so you might not see the others who are lower on your list. Editing their names to include something that will help you search for them will make it easier to avoid forgetting to send them a snap regularly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/edit-the-name-of-your-snapchat-friend.jpg"                      alt="edit the name of your snapchat friend"                ></p><p><strong>Idea 2. Pin Your Conversations</strong></p><p>If you want to keep someone at the top of your chat list, consider pinning their chat. This will also ultimately help you send snaps to them without breaking the streak.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/pin-conversation-in-snapchat.jpg"                      alt="pin conversation in snapchat"                ></p><p><strong>Idea 3. Stick to a Particular Time of the Day</strong></p><p>You will gain more by starting your Snapstreaks later on in the day, especially if you are only sending one snap per day. This way, the hourglass emoji will be visible for a considerable amount of time before it expires.</p><p><strong>Idea 4. Check Your Filters</strong></p><p>If you’re trying to keep up with multiple Snapstreaks at once, it’s easy to forget who you’re on a streak with. But there’s a way to see them without going to your list of friends.</p><p>Whenever you’re about to send a new snap, swipe through the filters. Here, you’ll see a special Snapchat streak filter, which will show how many consecutive days of successful streak you have in big white numbers next to the fire emoji.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>In this article, we’ve compiled a list of fun and creative <strong>Snapchat streak ideas</strong> to help you stay connected with your friends.</p><p>Hopefully, by following these tips, you can now keep your Snapchat streak alive and stay connected with your contacts in a better and more engaging way!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><h2 id="Snap-It-Up-15-Powerful-Posting-Techniques-Revealed"><a href="#Snap-It-Up-15-Powerful-Posting-Techniques-Revealed" class="headerlink" title="Snap It Up! 15 Powerful Posting Techniques Revealed"></a>Snap It Up! 15 Powerful Posting Techniques Revealed</h2><p>Snapchat is the 12th most popular social platform, with over <a class="link"   href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/545967/snapchat-app-dau/" >347 million daily active <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>users, a <a class="link"   href="https://www.gobankingrates.com/money/business/how-much-is-snapchat-worth/" >market cap of $17.13B <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and a <a class="link"   href="https://www.gobankingrates.com/money/business/how-much-is-snapchat-worth/" >net worth of $1.07B <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Create Title Cards For Longer Snapchat Stories</h3><p>If you’re creating a Snapchat story that is longer than the standard 10 seconds, you can use title cards to help keep your viewers engaged.</p><p>Title cards are simply images with the text you can insert into your story to help identify what’s coming next. For example, if you’re sharing a story about your company’s history, you could use a title card at the beginning of each section to identify the different parts of the story.</p><p>For this, you can take a snap of a wall or perhaps block your camera to get a black screen and then paste your text on the picture. You can also play with the font size, style, or color to create engaging title cards.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/title-cards-for-snapchat-stories.jpg"                      alt="title cards for snapchat stories"                ></p><h3 id="Idea-2-Adding-Music-To-Your-Video"><a href="#Idea-2-Adding-Music-To-Your-Video" class="headerlink" title="Idea 2.

However, Snapchat marketing can be challenging, as the platform constantly evolves and changes.</p><p>This article provides an overview of <strong>Snapchat marketing strategy,</strong> including why businesses should market on this platform, what types of content to post, and how to measure results.</p><p>With the information available in this article, you will be able to create a strategy that works for your business and get succeeded.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/snapchat-app.jpg"                      alt="snapchat app"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Snapchat-Overview"><a href="#Part-1-Snapchat-Overview" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Snapchat Overview"></a>Part 1. Snapchat Overview</h2><p>Firstly, let’s have an overview of Snapchat before we see how to draw your blueprint in Part 3 and Part 4.</p><p>Snapchat - founded by Evan Spiegel, Bobby Murphy, and Reggie Brown - is a unique messaging app because it allows users to send disappearing messages and photos. This feature has made the app popular with young people aged 13-34 who want to communicate without leaving a permanent record.</p><p>As of May 2022, Snapchat has <a class="link"   href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/545967/snapchat-app-dau/#:~:text=How%20many%20daily%20active%20users,increase%20of%20over%2018%20percent." >347 million daily active users. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> That’s impressive growth from its humble beginnings back in 2011. With <a class="link"   href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/272014/global-social-networks-ranked-by-number-of-users/" >monthly active users of 557 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, Snapchat is ranked as the 12th most popular social media platform.</p><p>Not only that, the number of <a class="link"   href="https://www.omnicoreagency.com/snapchat-statistics/" >Snapchat daily video views is 18 billion, <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> making it the best platform to showcase your services&#x2F;products and generate more income. However, all this is only possible with the right <strong>Snapchat marketing strategy.</strong></p><h2 id="Part-2-Why-Should-Business-Market-On-Snapchat"><a href="#Part-2-Why-Should-Business-Market-On-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Why Should Business Market On Snapchat"></a>Part 2. Why Should Business Market On Snapchat</h2><p>So you are probably thinking why your business should be on Snapchat - because it’s popular with teenagers and young adults. In fact, the platform has over 347 million daily active users, with <strong>75%</strong> being under the age of 34.</p><p>Therefore, if you’re targeting a younger demographic, then Snapchat should definitely be part of your social media marketing strategy.</p><p>Another big reason is that Snapchat is incredibly engaging. The average Snapchat user opens the app at least 20 times a day and spends 25 - 30 minutes on the app each day, so that’s a lot of potential exposure for your business.</p><p>Not only that, but since Snapchat is still a new field and opened up <a class="link"   href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/20/snapchat-messaging-app-ad-creepy-ouija" >ads to users in October 2014, <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> many big companies have not entered the market. This has created a huge opportunity for small businesses to market their products and generate leads to increase their sales.</p><p>With Snapchat, you can get discovered by users in their Discovery feeds or via Stories. Also, they can interact with your brand using the Geofilters, stickers, and lenses you’ve produced during your ad campaign.</p><p>For instance, Taco Bell created a filter for Cinco de Mayo. The filter received 224 Million views, which is insane. Nevertheless, this campaign kept users engaged and helped increase Taco Bell’s sales.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/taco-bell-cinco-de-mayo-filter-on-snapchat.jpg"                      alt="taco bell cinco de mayo filter on snapchat"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Where-To-Start-Your-Snapchat-Marketing-Strategy"><a href="#Part-3-Where-To-Start-Your-Snapchat-Marketing-Strategy" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

In this era of digitalization, one can easily interact with friends on social media. With the emergence of social media, it has now become convenient to maintain social connections and support networks that otherwise wouldn’t have been possible. Social networking platforms have made staying connected with friends, family, and other acquaintances easier than ever.</p><p>Snapchat is one such platform that has gained immense popularity over recent years. A multimedia messaging app, it allows you to share pictures and videos with your friends and dear ones. The app lets you take snaps and apply filters and lenses to best express yourself. You can use the <strong>best Snapchat filters</strong> and lenses to add personality and whimsy to snaps.</p><p>Whether you want to have some fun with your friends or want to impress someone, Snapchat has amazing effects for every occasion. Indeed, Instagram’s story highlights have become one of the biggest social media platforms. However, by the end of June 2021, Snapchat claimed to have increased its global daily active users to 293 million.</p><p>Snapchat’s lenses and filters have become so famous that Instagram has mimicked the feature. But, there’s a reason why snaps are regularly circulating outside Snapchat - the fantastic creative effects give it a leg up over Instagram. Snapchat’s extensive collection of funny lenses, cool filters, and stunning beauty filters makes it way better than Instagram’s.</p><p>Wondering how to find good face modifiers from a sea of clones out there? Relax! Our team at Wondershare has done the hard work and made a list of the best filters and lenses on Snapchat. But, first, let’s have a detailed insight into the best Snapchat filters and lenses.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What Are the Differences Between Snapchat Filters and Lenses?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: 20 Best Filters &amp; Lenses On Snapchat to Use in 2021</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: FAQs About Snapchat Filters &amp; Lenses</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-What-Are-the-Differences-Between-Snapchat-Filters-and-Lenses"><a href="#Part-1-What-Are-the-Differences-Between-Snapchat-Filters-and-Lenses" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Are the Differences Between Snapchat Filters and Lenses?"></a>Part 1: What Are the Differences Between Snapchat Filters and Lenses?</h2><p>Snapchat filters are static overlays and sit on the top of your photo or video. In contrast, Snapchat lenses are dynamic, augmented reality animations that alter your voice along with your appearance as you move on the screen. Unlike filters that are added after taking a photo, lenses are displayed while you’re taking the photo.</p><p>The best filters on Snapchat let you change a snap’s tint or change the direction or speed in which your video is played back. On the other hand, Snapchat lenses work by utilizing facial recognition software to track your features and apply an animation that follows your facial movements. While lenses can change the sound of your voice and the appearance of your face, filters can only add color tones, messages, customized images, and icons to your snaps.</p><p>The photo and video sharing app allow you to make your own filters and lenses. Creating a filter on Snapchat isn’t free as you will have to pay a certain amount based on the filter’s square foot. However, when it comes to making your own Snapchat lens, you won’t have to pay any fees as the entire process is free.</p><h2 id="Part-2-20-Best-Filters-Lenses-On-Snapchat-to-Use-in-2021"><a href="#Part-2-20-Best-Filters-Lenses-On-Snapchat-to-Use-in-2021" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 20 Best Filters &amp; Lenses On Snapchat to Use in 2021"></a>Part 2: 20 Best Filters &amp; Lenses On Snapchat to Use in 2021</h2><h3 id="Best-Snapchat-Filters-For-Selfies"><a href="#Best-Snapchat-Filters-For-Selfies" class="headerlink" title="Best Snapchat Filters For Selfies"></a>Best Snapchat Filters For Selfies</h3><p>Getting bored with the regular filters that add some brightness and little symbols to selfies?

These sent MMS are known as “Snaps,” and you can set a time limit on how long recipients can view them (a maximum of 24 hours, after which they will be automatically deleted).</p><p>Since its inception, Snapchat has evolved to include a wider range of features, including live video chat, story sharing, and lenses (augmented reality filters). Each of these functions is discussed below in detail:</p><ul><li><strong>Chat:</strong> A messaging functionality you can use to communicate with your friends and family, share snaps, send stickers, or make a video&#x2F;audio call.</li><li><strong>Stories:</strong> With this feature, you can add a compilation of images or videos for public viewing - available for 24 hours and then automatically disappear.</li><li><strong>Live Stories:</strong> There are stories of other users from a specific location or event that disappear after 24 hours.</li><li><strong>Lenses:</strong> These AR filters can be used to add fun effects to your pictures and post them as your stories or send them to someone.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/snapchat-lens.jpg"                      alt="snapchat lens"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Filters:</strong> Unlike lenses, they are static photo <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >overlays&#x2F;effects <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that you can apply to your pictures to make them more captivating.</li><li><strong>Snap Map:</strong> This functionality lets you share your location with your friends.

From selfies to shots of food, videos taken during nights on the town to holiday adventures, Snapchat is the perfect video and image-sharing platform for Social Media fans.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/logo_icon/wondershare-filmora-logo-horizontal.png"                      alt="Filmora logo"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/common/filmora-product-banner.png"                      alt="filmora product interface"                ></p><h3 id="The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor"><a href="#The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor"></a>The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Record PC screen <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, voiceover, and webcam simultaneously</li><li>Edit recorded clips quickly with a wide range of professional tools</li><li>Built-in plentiful templates and effects</li><li>Export to MP4, MOV, MKV, GIF and multiple formats</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static.wondershare.com/images-filmora/images/common/securety.svg"                      alt="secure download"                >Secure Download</p><h2 id="How-to-screenshot-on-snapchat-without-stimulating-a-notification"><a href="#How-to-screenshot-on-snapchat-without-stimulating-a-notification" class="headerlink" title="How to screenshot on snapchat without stimulating a notification?"></a>How to screenshot on snapchat without stimulating a notification?</h2><p>An incredible application that allows you to send and share videos and images with friends and followers, Snapchat is designed to help you stay connected in more ways than one. Featuring an anti-screenshot notification system that automatically notifies posters when a recipient or audience member screenshots a snap, it’s become increasingly harder to screenshot without being detected.</p><p>That being said, there are still plenty of other methods that offer a practical alternative to ensure you avoid that awkward automated notification.</p><h4 id="Option-1-Use-Another-Phone-or-Mobile-Device-to-Take-Snapchat-Screenshot"><a href="#Option-1-Use-Another-Phone-or-Mobile-Device-to-Take-Snapchat-Screenshot" class="headerlink" title="Option 1. Use Another Phone or Mobile Device to Take Snapchat Screenshot"></a>Option 1. Use Another Phone or Mobile Device to Take Snapchat Screenshot</h4><p>An easy and risk-free way to capture and store a specific snap with ease, utilizing another mobile device or camera is a great method that requires very little effort. Simply us a second phone, or a nearby tablet, to record the whole duration of the video or photo.</p><p>Although the quality of the recording won’t be as crisp and clear as it appears on the handheld, this is a reliable and fool-proof way to preserve those special snaps. From those video recordings, you should then be able to crop out the video or image you needed.</p><p>Missed it?</p><p>Why not take advantage of Snapchat’s “replay” mode to ensure you get the perfect shot – but be warned, posters also get notified of this too.</p><h4 id="Option-2-Use-the-Built-In-Screen-Recoding-Tool-on-iOS11"><a href="#Option-2-Use-the-Built-In-Screen-Recoding-Tool-on-iOS11" class="headerlink" title="Option 2. Use the Built-In Screen Recoding Tool on iOS11"></a>Option 2. Use the Built-In Screen Recoding Tool on iOS11</h4><p>If you didn’t already know, there’s a built-in screen recording software within iOS11 that allows you to effectively capture and record snaps with ease. Lying within the Settings of any iPhone, follow these easy steps on how to live record your screen:</p><ul><li>Step 1: Head to Settings &gt; Control Centre &gt; Customize Controls</li><li>Step 2: Locate the “Screen Recording” functionality</li><li>Step 3: Select the small cross to add it to your Control Centre</li><li>Step 4: To activate – Tap the icon with the 2 concentric circles to start recording. To complete a recording, simply tap the red bar that’s present at the top of the screen and select “End Recording”.</li></ul><p>Although it’s not possible to start recording a snap whilst it’s already open, it’s best to start recording before you opt to open a specific message.</p><p>Please note: If you have updated to Snapchat version 10.17.5, the posters will be notified each and every time you initiate and capture a recording through the use of this built-in recorder.</p><h4 id="Option-3-Use-QuickTime-Screen-Capture-on-a-Mac"><a href="#Option-3-Use-QuickTime-Screen-Capture-on-a-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Option 3. Use QuickTime Screen Capture on a Mac"></a>Option 3. Use QuickTime Screen Capture on a Mac</h4><p>A little more technical than simply using another mobile device to record a snap, using the QuickTime Player is an efficient and high-quality method for those looking to secretly store a snapchat post.</p><p>To start recording snaps, follow these simple steps:</p><ul><li>Step 1: Connect your iPhone to your Mac</li><li>Step 2: Open the QuickTime Player application</li><li>Step 3: Select <strong>File &gt; New Movie Recording</strong> from the menu</li><li>Step 4: Once loaded, simply hover the mouse beside the recording button. By clicking the small arrow, you’ll be provided with a range of different recording options</li><li>Step 5: Select your Phone as the <strong>Movie Recording Input</strong></li></ul><p>Once connected, your Mac screen should now be mirroring your mobile device. Just like you would on your phone, simply hit record and head on over to the Snapchat application to begin recording.</p><h4 id="Option-4-Use-the-Mirror-Feature-for-Android"><a href="#Option-4-Use-the-Mirror-Feature-for-Android" class="headerlink" title="Option 4. Use the Mirror Feature for Android"></a>Option 4. Use the Mirror Feature for Android</h4><p>Similar to the use of QuickTime or the iOS11 Screen Recording software, Screen Mirroring is another effective method for capturing Snapchat screenshots without the poster being made aware. By connecting a HDMI cable to both your TV and laptop, or by accessing the “Screen Mirroring” application that’s often built-in to most Smart Phones and Android devices, it’s possible to mirror&#x2F;cast the active screen on your device onto an external platform.</p><p>In doing so, you’re presented with the opportunity to utilize another device to record a playing snap or even share a recently received snap with other audience members that are present in the room.</p><h4 id="Option-5-Delay-the-Snapchat-Screenshot-Notification"><a href="#Option-5-Delay-the-Snapchat-Screenshot-Notification" class="headerlink" title="Option 5. Delay the Snapchat Screenshot Notification"></a>Option 5. Delay the Snapchat Screenshot Notification</h4><p>A method for those feeling a more confident or even for those that aren’t too bothered about their posters receiving a notification in the long run, this method is a great way to delay the arrival of that pop-down notification.</p><p>To delay the notification process, follow these simple steps:</p><ul><li>Step 1: Load the Snapchat application on your mobile device</li><li>Step 2: Find the snap you want to open&#x2F;record (ensure it is fully loaded)</li><li>Step 3: Turn off WiFi, Bluetooth, Mobile Data</li><li>Step 4: Turn on the Airplane Mode</li><li>Step 5: Open the snap and take your screenshot</li><li>Step 6: Wait approximately 30 seconds and then turn all your connections back on</li></ul><p>Designed to postpone the process of the poster receiving a notification, but not allowing for viewers to screenshot undetected, this method allows audience members to screenshot snaps from those that are perhaps a little unobservant when it comes to checking their notifications.</p><p>Be warned though, some posters may catch on to this method of screenshotting and they may stop sharing their videos and images with you.</p><h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>Despite there being plenty of reasons why there might be a need for you to record a Snapchat memory without the sender being made aware, it’s important to note that this can also be viewed as a breach of privacy with senders not only being informed of who has taken a screenshot, but also how many times they’ve done so and of which post.</p><p>With Snapchat designed to maintain the notion that any media sent between users is considered temporary, thanks to the 5-10 second duration limit, the methods listed above, although not fail-proof, are suggested as simple yet effective ways to avoid triggering an unwanted notification whilst using this highly popular social networking application.</p><p><a

Snapchat is a way to restrict the people who can see the story. Snapchat provides options on <strong>how to make a private story on Snapchat</strong> and share the same to a select few. With such a feature you have more control over who sees the content you publish. A Snapchat private story is easy to create, the only difference is how you send the video or story across to the people you choose. You can do so on the Snapchat application on an Android as well as on an iOS device. Here we explore how such a story can be created and published or posted privately.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snapchat-name-ideas.jpg"                      alt="Snapchat Name Ideas"                ></p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What Is a Private Story on Snapchat?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: How to Create a Private Story on Snapchat?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: Creative Private Story Names and Ideas for Snapchat</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: Troubleshooting Tips: When Someone Hide Their Snapchat Stories from You</a></li></ul><h2 id="What-Is-a-Private-Story-on-Snapchat"><a href="#What-Is-a-Private-Story-on-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="What Is a Private Story on Snapchat?"></a>What Is a Private Story on Snapchat?</h2><p>Stories are a term popular in Snapchat, to showcase images and videos for the last 24 hours. Stories can comprise photos as well as videos. You can post stories to your feed which you can view as well as your friends. These show your friends your different activities the day before. These exist for the next 24 hours within which you can replay them many times.</p><p>There is a difference between ‘My Stories’ and ‘Private Stories’. When you record and post a video or a photo on your Snapchat account publicly, it is seen by all your contacts. On the other hand, if you wish to post a private story, you need to create a custom story. After you create a custom story, you can then post the same as a private one. Here you select the ones who would view the story. You choose the contacts who would view the post before publishing it. Another aspect is that no one else can add content to the private stories you post on Snapchat.</p><h2 id="How-to-Create-a-Private-Story-on-Snapchat"><a href="#How-to-Create-a-Private-Story-on-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="How to Create a Private Story on Snapchat?"></a>How to Create a Private Story on Snapchat?</h2><p>To begin how to make a private story on Snapchat, here are the steps to follow:</p><ul><li><a href="#part5">1.Log into Your Account.</a></li><li><a href="#part6">2.Visit Your Profile Page</a></li><li><a href="#part7">3.Select the Private Story option</a></li><li><a href="#part8">4.Create the Story</a></li><li><a href="#part9">5.Share with Your Select Friends</a></li></ul><h4 id="1-Log-into-Your-Account"><a href="#1-Log-into-Your-Account" class="headerlink" title="1.Log into Your Account"></a>1.Log into Your Account</h4><p>Start by logging in to your Snapchat account.

You can use someone else’s account to check if their stories are showing on their feed. You could also send a private snap to that person. If he or she answers the same quickly and yet, you do not get to see their stories that would mean that you are hidden contact in their list.</p><p>You could also ask a common friend if they have even received stories and updates from that person. If the person’s stories are reaching others but not you, that means that they have hidden their stories from you.</p><p><strong>Can You Hide Someone on Snapchat Without Them Knowing?</strong></p><p>If you wish to hide someone but in a way that they do not find out, try the new muting function. This allows you to mute certain friends without them realizing the same. The feature is called ‘Do Not Disturb’ and it allows you to mute conversations that are one on one or come from groups. The feature is a new addition and is a useful one.

The popup menu would include ‘Settings’ and here you can select the option ‘Do Not Disturb’. You will not receive notifications from such conversations. However, you will still be able to access, check messages from such contacts as well as share your stories as well.</p><p>This feature is a useful addition and you need not hide or block a contact to silence conversations from them. Hence, those people will also not get notified unlike when you block a contact.

However, Snapchat marketing can be challenging, as the platform constantly evolves and changes.</p><p>This article provides an overview of <strong>Snapchat marketing strategy,</strong> including why businesses should market on this platform, what types of content to post, and how to measure results.</p><p>With the information available in this article, you will be able to create a strategy that works for your business and get succeeded.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/snapchat-app.jpg"                      alt="snapchat app"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Snapchat-Overview"><a href="#Part-1-Snapchat-Overview" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Snapchat Overview"></a>Part 1. Snapchat Overview</h2><p>Firstly, let’s have an overview of Snapchat before we see how to draw your blueprint in Part 3 and Part 4.</p><p>Snapchat - founded by Evan Spiegel, Bobby Murphy, and Reggie Brown - is a unique messaging app because it allows users to send disappearing messages and photos. This feature has made the app popular with young people aged 13-34 who want to communicate without leaving a permanent record.</p><p>As of May 2022, Snapchat has <a class="link"   href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/545967/snapchat-app-dau/#:~:text=How%20many%20daily%20active%20users,increase%20of%20over%2018%20percent." >347 million daily active users. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> That’s impressive growth from its humble beginnings back in 2011. With <a class="link"   href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/272014/global-social-networks-ranked-by-number-of-users/" >monthly active users of 557 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, Snapchat is ranked as the 12th most popular social media platform.</p><p>Not only that, the number of <a class="link"   href="https://www.omnicoreagency.com/snapchat-statistics/" >Snapchat daily video views is 18 billion, <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> making it the best platform to showcase your services&#x2F;products and generate more income. However, all this is only possible with the right <strong>Snapchat marketing strategy.</strong></p><h2 id="Part-2-Why-Should-Business-Market-On-Snapchat"><a href="#Part-2-Why-Should-Business-Market-On-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Why Should Business Market On Snapchat"></a>Part 2. Why Should Business Market On Snapchat</h2><p>So you are probably thinking why your business should be on Snapchat - because it’s popular with teenagers and young adults. In fact, the platform has over 347 million daily active users, with <strong>75%</strong> being under the age of 34.</p><p>Therefore, if you’re targeting a younger demographic, then Snapchat should definitely be part of your social media marketing strategy.</p><p>Another big reason is that Snapchat is incredibly engaging. The average Snapchat user opens the app at least 20 times a day and spends 25 - 30 minutes on the app each day, so that’s a lot of potential exposure for your business.</p><p>Not only that, but since Snapchat is still a new field and opened up <a class="link"   href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/20/snapchat-messaging-app-ad-creepy-ouija" >ads to users in October 2014, <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> many big companies have not entered the market. This has created a huge opportunity for small businesses to market their products and generate leads to increase their sales.</p><p>With Snapchat, you can get discovered by users in their Discovery feeds or via Stories. Also, they can interact with your brand using the Geofilters, stickers, and lenses you’ve produced during your ad campaign.</p><p>For instance, Taco Bell created a filter for Cinco de Mayo. The filter received 224 Million views, which is insane. Nevertheless, this campaign kept users engaged and helped increase Taco Bell’s sales.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/taco-bell-cinco-de-mayo-filter-on-snapchat.jpg"                      alt="taco bell cinco de mayo filter on snapchat"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Where-To-Start-Your-Snapchat-Marketing-Strategy"><a href="#Part-3-Where-To-Start-Your-Snapchat-Marketing-Strategy" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

Featuring an anti-screenshot notification system that automatically notifies posters when a recipient or audience member screenshots a snap, it’s become increasingly harder to screenshot without being detected.</p><p>That being said, there are still plenty of other methods that offer a practical alternative to ensure you avoid that awkward automated notification.</p><h4 id="Option-1-Use-Another-Phone-or-Mobile-Device-to-Take-Snapchat-Screenshot"><a href="#Option-1-Use-Another-Phone-or-Mobile-Device-to-Take-Snapchat-Screenshot" class="headerlink" title="Option 1. Use Another Phone or Mobile Device to Take Snapchat Screenshot"></a>Option 1. Use Another Phone or Mobile Device to Take Snapchat Screenshot</h4><p>An easy and risk-free way to capture and store a specific snap with ease, utilizing another mobile device or camera is a great method that requires very little effort.

Use the Built-In Screen Recoding Tool on iOS11</h4><p>If you didn’t already know, there’s a built-in screen recording software within iOS11 that allows you to effectively capture and record snaps with ease. Lying within the Settings of any iPhone, follow these easy steps on how to live record your screen:</p><ul><li>Step 1: Head to Settings &gt; Control Centre &gt; Customize Controls</li><li>Step 2: Locate the “Screen Recording” functionality</li><li>Step 3: Select the small cross to add it to your Control Centre</li><li>Step 4: To activate – Tap the icon with the 2 concentric circles to start recording. To complete a recording, simply tap the red bar that’s present at the top of the screen and select “End Recording”.</li></ul><p>Although it’s not possible to start recording a snap whilst it’s already open, it’s best to start recording before you opt to open a specific message.</p><p>Please note: If you have updated to Snapchat version 10.17.5, the posters will be notified each and every time you initiate and capture a recording through the use of this built-in recorder.</p><h4 id="Option-3-Use-QuickTime-Screen-Capture-on-a-Mac"><a href="#Option-3-Use-QuickTime-Screen-Capture-on-a-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Option 3. Use QuickTime Screen Capture on a Mac"></a>Option 3. Use QuickTime Screen Capture on a Mac</h4><p>A little more technical than simply using another mobile device to record a snap, using the QuickTime Player is an efficient and high-quality method for those looking to secretly store a snapchat post.</p><p>To start recording snaps, follow these simple steps:</p><ul><li>Step 1: Connect your iPhone to your Mac</li><li>Step 2: Open the QuickTime Player application</li><li>Step 3: Select <strong>File &gt; New Movie Recording</strong> from the menu</li><li>Step 4: Once loaded, simply hover the mouse beside the recording button. By clicking the small arrow, you’ll be provided with a range of different recording options</li><li>Step 5: Select your Phone as the <strong>Movie Recording Input</strong></li></ul><p>Once connected, your Mac screen should now be mirroring your mobile device.

Use the Mirror Feature for Android"></a>Option 4. Use the Mirror Feature for Android</h4><p>Similar to the use of QuickTime or the iOS11 Screen Recording software, Screen Mirroring is another effective method for capturing Snapchat screenshots without the poster being made aware. By connecting a HDMI cable to both your TV and laptop, or by accessing the “Screen Mirroring” application that’s often built-in to most Smart Phones and Android devices, it’s possible to mirror&#x2F;cast the active screen on your device onto an external platform.</p><p>In doing so, you’re presented with the opportunity to utilize another device to record a playing snap or even share a recently received snap with other audience members that are present in the room.</p><h4 id="Option-5-Delay-the-Snapchat-Screenshot-Notification"><a href="#Option-5-Delay-the-Snapchat-Screenshot-Notification" class="headerlink" title="Option 5.

Snapchat Overview"></a>Part 1. Snapchat Overview</h2><p>Firstly, let’s have an overview of Snapchat before we see how to draw your blueprint in Part 3 and Part 4.</p><p>Snapchat - founded by Evan Spiegel, Bobby Murphy, and Reggie Brown - is a unique messaging app because it allows users to send disappearing messages and photos. This feature has made the app popular with young people aged 13-34 who want to communicate without leaving a permanent record.</p><p>As of May 2022, Snapchat has <a class="link"   href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/545967/snapchat-app-dau/#:~:text=How%20many%20daily%20active%20users,increase%20of%20over%2018%20percent." >347 million daily active users. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> That’s impressive growth from its humble beginnings back in 2011. With <a class="link"   href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/272014/global-social-networks-ranked-by-number-of-users/" >monthly active users of 557 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, Snapchat is ranked as the 12th most popular social media platform.</p><p>Not only that, the number of <a class="link"   href="https://www.omnicoreagency.com/snapchat-statistics/" >Snapchat daily video views is 18 billion, <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> making it the best platform to showcase your services&#x2F;products and generate more income. However, all this is only possible with the right <strong>Snapchat marketing strategy.</strong></p><h2 id="Part-2-Why-Should-Business-Market-On-Snapchat"><a href="#Part-2-Why-Should-Business-Market-On-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Why Should Business Market On Snapchat"></a>Part 2. Why Should Business Market On Snapchat</h2><p>So you are probably thinking why your business should be on Snapchat - because it’s popular with teenagers and young adults. In fact, the platform has over 347 million daily active users, with <strong>75%</strong> being under the age of 34.</p><p>Therefore, if you’re targeting a younger demographic, then Snapchat should definitely be part of your social media marketing strategy.</p><p>Another big reason is that Snapchat is incredibly engaging. The average Snapchat user opens the app at least 20 times a day and spends 25 - 30 minutes on the app each day, so that’s a lot of potential exposure for your business.</p><p>Not only that, but since Snapchat is still a new field and opened up <a class="link"   href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/20/snapchat-messaging-app-ad-creepy-ouija" >ads to users in October 2014, <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> many big companies have not entered the market. This has created a huge opportunity for small businesses to market their products and generate leads to increase their sales.</p><p>With Snapchat, you can get discovered by users in their Discovery feeds or via Stories. Also, they can interact with your brand using the Geofilters, stickers, and lenses you’ve produced during your ad campaign.</p><p>For instance, Taco Bell created a filter for Cinco de Mayo. The filter received 224 Million views, which is insane. Nevertheless, this campaign kept users engaged and helped increase Taco Bell’s sales.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/taco-bell-cinco-de-mayo-filter-on-snapchat.jpg"                      alt="taco bell cinco de mayo filter on snapchat"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Where-To-Start-Your-Snapchat-Marketing-Strategy"><a href="#Part-3-Where-To-Start-Your-Snapchat-Marketing-Strategy" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

They can be up to 24 hours long, and are viewable an unlimited number of times within that time frame.</p><p>You can create a Snapchat Story by taking a series of snaps and adding text, filters, and other effects to make the content more engaging and share it with your followers or make it public afterward.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/snapchat-stories.jpg"                      alt="snapchat stories"                ></p><p>Here are a few tips and approaches to help you create a Snapchat story that will capture your audience’s attention:</p><ul><li><strong>Keep it short and sweet:</strong> Snapchat stories are only 10 seconds long, so make sure your story is concise and to the point.</li><li><strong>Use high-quality visuals:</strong> Since Snapchat is all about visuals, use high-quality images and videos in your story.</li><li><strong>Be creative</strong>: Use Snapchat’s unique features, such as filters and augmented reality, to create a story that is truly one of a kind.</li></ul><h3 id="How-To-Advertise-With-Snapchat-1"><a href="#How-To-Advertise-With-Snapchat-1" class="headerlink" title="How To Advertise With Snapchat"></a>How To Advertise With Snapchat</h3><p>Snapchat Ads are a form of advertisement that allows businesses to reach out to Snapchat users with creative and interactive content.

To learn how to create stunning and effective Snapchat ads, please read<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Snapchat Ad 101 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h3 id="Sponsored-Geofilters-1"><a href="#Sponsored-Geofilters-1" class="headerlink" title="Sponsored Geofilters"></a>Sponsored Geofilters</h3><p>Geofilters are location-specific AR filters that you can create on-demand for your business to attract more customers. These filters can cost you <strong>$5 to $20</strong> depending upon the area&#x2F; square feet and duration, but they will surely help you attract more customers, resulting in more revenue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/on-demand-geofilters.jpg"                      alt="on demand geofilters"                ></p><h3 id="Sponsored-Lenses-1"><a href="#Sponsored-Lenses-1" class="headerlink" title="Sponsored Lenses"></a>Sponsored Lenses</h3><p>Sponsored lenses are AR filters businesses produce to interact with their users on Snapchat. Users can use these lenses to make inspiring snaps, send them to friends or have fun playing games using the gamified lenses.</p><p>For instance, Sephora created a gamified AR experience for their advertisement campaign on Snapchat. They provide coupons and promo codes to the users who completed the game. This helped them boost their products’ sales and ultimately generate more sales.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/snapchat-sponsored-lenses.jpg"                      alt="snapchat sponsored lenses"                ></p><h3 id="Snapchat-Discover-1"><a href="#Snapchat-Discover-1" class="headerlink" title="Snapchat Discover"></a>Snapchat Discover</h3><p>Snapchat Discover is a feature that helps brands to publish stories on the Snapchat app. This content is designed to be consumed in short, snackable bites - perfect for the attention-deficient millennial.</p><p>You can get almost 2 times more traffic on your website by having a channel on Snapchat Discover and sharing engaging content with clickable links.</p><h3 id="Track-and-Measure-your-Marketing-Results-1"><a href="#Track-and-Measure-your-Marketing-Results-1" class="headerlink" title="Track and Measure your Marketing Results"></a>Track and Measure your Marketing Results</h3><p>You’ve created a Snapchat marketing strategy and are ready to start reaching your target audience. But how will you monitor if your marketing efforts are successful? The key is to track and measure your results so that you can make adjustments as needed.</p><p>While Snapchat doesn’t offer robust analytics data, you can track the following metrics to monitor the results:</p><ul><li>By checking the number of views on your stories and ads to see how many people are viewing them.</li><li>Check the length of the Story that received more viewers and try to make future ads and stories of the same length.</li><li>Monitor the number of views on your First Snap and Last Snap and check whether the views are increasing or not.</li><li>Analyze Engagement (the number of screenshots or direct messages) on your ads and stories. This will clearly tell you about your performance.</li><li>Check the completion Rate (percentage of users who watched your stories and compare it with the increase in sales to see whether you are performing well or not.</li></ul><p>Apart from what has been mentioned above, we have also prepared you with a video about how to develop business on Snapchat.

While Facebook and Instagram have long been in the scene, new ones like TikTok and Snapchat are starting to pop up. If you are operating your business in the 21st century and still have not developed your presence in them, then, believe it or not, you are truly missing out on a whole lot of opportunities. But the million-dollar question is – what’s the difference between the two marketing channels from the perspective of an influencer and a marketer? The article here draws out the dissimilarities between the two for the brands to identify the most fitting potential marketing channel to promote themselves.</p><h2 id="Basic-Comparison-Between-TikTok-and-Snapchat"><a href="#Basic-Comparison-Between-TikTok-and-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="Basic Comparison Between TikTok and Snapchat"></a>Basic Comparison Between TikTok and Snapchat</h2><p>Before digging into the dissimilarities between the two apps, don’t you think it’s better to draw insight into them individually? The section here introduces both TikTok and Snapchat individually, highlighting interesting facts that might help you draw out the basic differences between the two social media networks.</p><p><strong>TikTok Fundamentals</strong></p><p>A very popular video-sharing app, launched by the Chinese multinational internet technology company ByteDance in 2017. By the end of 2018, it took the world by storm, especially in the USA. At the end of 2019, it generated 1.5 billion downloads from all around the world.</p><p>Regarding its purpose, it was tailored to entertain users with short, looping, mostly humorous videos. If you are looking for a platform to showcase your talent with choreographed dance numbers, reaction videos, lip-syncing, and a potent participant of hashtag challenge, TikTok is the ideal platform to open up.</p><p>Popular mostly among the Gen-Z audience, 49% of whom hail from the age cohort 13-16, it once again proves its competitiveness in the list of social media networks. As per advertising is concerned, it’s mostly in the form of branded filters, takeovers, top view ads, hashtag challenges, in-feed native video ads, and influencer brand partnerships.</p><p><strong>Snapchat Fundamentals</strong></p><p>A mobile messaging app ideal for sharing both visual, and textual content, including videos, photos and texts. Unlike TikTok, it’s relatively old and was launched back in the year 2011.</p><p>Contrary to TikTok, Snapchat does not just allow users to keep pace with the current trend but also connect with buddies over Stories and other ephemeral content. It’s empowering both users and brands with abilities to showcase creativity through 3D environment interactions, object scanning, and try-on effects.</p><p>Regarding its target audience, they are mostly the millennials, 218 million of whom fall into the list of active users. From a marketing perspective, it permits brands to promote themselves through shoppable ads, branded filters, personalized targeting, AR lenses, and Snap Ad.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Basic Difference</strong></th><th><strong>TikTok</strong></th><th><strong>Snapchat</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>App Type</strong></td><td>Video-sharing app</td><td>Mobile messaging app</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Usage</strong></td><td>For the sake of Entertainment</td><td>Connecting with friends and updating oneself to the latest trends</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Audience</strong></td><td>Gen-Z</td><td>Millennials</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Advertising</strong></td><td>CPM (Cost Per Thousand Impressions) basis</td><td>Snap Ad, Shoppable ads, Personalized Targeting &amp; Native Checkout</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="TikTok-vs-Snapchat-What-Influencers-Need-to-Know"><a href="#TikTok-vs-Snapchat-What-Influencers-Need-to-Know" class="headerlink" title="TikTok vs. Snapchat: What Influencers Need to Know"></a>TikTok vs. Snapchat: What Influencers Need to Know</h2><p>Wondering what’s an Influencer? Well, it’s someone you hire to promote your organization’s products when you fail to reach out to a wider audience. The person entrusted with the responsibilities of marketing your brand will ensure the flooding in of more followers for greater exposure. It’s a concept similar to social media influencers that you would find in both TikTok and Snapchat.</p><p>From the stance of an Influencer, here are 5 differences between the two apps.</p><ul><li><strong>Core Features</strong></li></ul><p>Influencers tend to look for features for creating a gripping visual content. TikTok ushers a quite a few of them, including video capture, filter effects, sound library, impressive editing tools, creation prompts and a ‘For You’ page, where the discovery feed based on algorithm is available.</p><p>On the contrary, Snapchat features similar such tools but with the only difference being in the count. You will find here more options besides video capture and editing tools, these being text and video chat, AR Lenses, Story creation, Discover tab, image capture, and Snap Maps.</p><ul><li><strong>Type of Users</strong></li></ul><p>While in TikTok, you will mostly find the celebrities, renowned brands and content creators to flood the social media platform; in Snapchat, the crowd mostly comprises of publishers.</p><ul><li><strong>Demographic</strong></li></ul><p>Mostly Gen-Z occupies the crowd in TikTok, majority of whom belong to the age group 18-24. However, Snapchat is mostly dominated by millennials.</p><ul><li><strong>Active Users</strong></li></ul><p>The relatively new app of TikTok happens to attract fewer active users, accounting 41 million globally, whereas Snapchat enjoys the presence of 218 million population daily.</p><ul><li><strong>Downloads</strong></li></ul><p>Probably because TikTok is new to people that 738 million of them have downloaded the app from all around the world in the year 2019 itself. However, Snapchat recorded 75 million globally in the same year.</p><p>An influencer observes all the above statistics before choosing to go for the preferred social media network.</p><h2 id="TikTok-vs-Snapchat-What-Marketers-Should-Know"><a href="#TikTok-vs-Snapchat-What-Marketers-Should-Know" class="headerlink" title="TikTok vs. Snapchat: What Marketers Should Know"></a>TikTok vs. Snapchat: What Marketers Should Know</h2><p>Sometimes, marketers seem to put all their energy into an app without realizing the level of effectiveness it would generate. The same holds for TikTok and Snapchat. So, it’s always wise to walk through the pros and cons of both, seek out the contrasting points from the perspective of certain key indicators and then decide. If you are here wondering where to start your advertising campaign from, go through the points below to make an informed decision.</p><ul><li><strong>Content Marketing</strong></li></ul><p>Go for the TikTok app, if you are targeting the Gen-Z population and currently undergoing budget constraints. With inclusions of hashtags and keywords, you can optimize the video content, attract your target audience, and build a community around you. However, it’s not a very promising app for directing traffic to your website as the social media network allows only a few brands to share the link of their created videos in the website content.</p><p>On the contrary, Snapchat is the most favorable app among brands seeking a platform to launch short, bite-sized videos to promote a newly-launched product and gain admiration from both Gen-Z and millennials. And the best thing? You can always draw online traffic to your website through them and generate greater conversions.</p><ul><li><strong>Marketing Opportunities</strong></li></ul><p>Lucrative opportunities await the small businesses investing their time and energy in TikTok because the platform being relatively new, sets limited norms on what makes content engaging and what fails to achieve it.

If you are seeking a platform that’s more stable and widely used up by the general population, Snapchat should be your go-to app. In the past, it has offered better ROI (Return on Investment) to brands choosing to reach out to their target audience through it. And, with ad offerings on the rise here, it’s certainly more approachable to brands. But, let’s not disregard TikTok because it’s in the nascent stage. Let’s not forget that it’s a great platform to run experiments and observe the reactions of Gen-Z before reaching out to millennials. The ball is in your court now. Go for whatever seems to be the most fitting for your business and look beyond the traditional social media networks for a change to stay afloat in the market.</p><p><img

Ideas To Create And Send Snaps Quickly"></a>Tip 1. Ideas To Create And Send Snaps Quickly</h3><p>Below are some tips&#x2F;ideas to help you quickly create and send Snaps to keep your Snapchat streak alive:</p><p><strong>Idea 1. Edit Blank Snap And Send As New Snap</strong></p><p>If you have run out of snap ideas, don’t worry about sending a high-quality one. No one is judging you, so send a blank snap to keep the streak alive; however, edit it a little so it looks like you have put in some effort.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/sending-a-blank-screen-to-keep-streak-alive.jpg"                      alt="sending a blank screen to keep streak alive"                ></p><p><strong>Idea 2. Send Black Screen</strong></p><p>Your Snapstreaks are about to expire, and you’re freaking out? Here’s a little hack that will keep them alive: send a black screen snap. That’s right! You can also add some doodles or stickers to the picture to make things look more interesting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/sending-blank-screen-as-snap.jpg"                      alt="sending blank screen as snap"                ></p><p><strong>Idea 3. Use Emojis And Bitmojis</strong></p><p>You can also add emojis or Bitmojis to your photos to make them look more interesting and fun. Simply open up the Snapchat app, click a picture, and tap on the emoji icon to select the emoji or Bitmoji that you want to add to your Snap. You can even resize and move them around to get it just right.</p><p><strong>Idea 4. Snap With Your Pets</strong></p><p>We all love our pets - and we also like staying connected with our friends on Snapchat. So why not combine the two? Occasionally take a picture of your pet using the app and send it to your besties to make their day and keep the streak alive!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/snap-with-pet-to-maintain-streak.jpg"                      alt="snap with pet to maintain streak"                ></p><p><strong>Idea 5. Streak With Daily Food</strong></p><p>Food is always a good topic and can be one of the best ways to keep your Snapchat streak alive. Simply send a snap to your friend every day before you start munching.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/streak-daily-food.jpg"                      alt="streak daily food"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-2-Seize-Occasions-And-Keep-Your-Snapchat-Sneak-Alive"><a href="#Tip-2-Seize-Occasions-And-Keep-Your-Snapchat-Sneak-Alive" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2. Seize Occasions And Keep Your Snapchat Sneak Alive"></a>Tip 2. Seize Occasions And Keep Your Snapchat Sneak Alive</h3><p>To keep your Snapchat streak alive, try to seize any opportunity you can to take pictures and send them to friends. Below are some ideas to do this:</p><p><strong>Idea 1. The First Day Matters</strong></p><p>Many people choose to start their streaks on special days because it helps them remember to keep them alive. For example, if you start your streak on your birthday, you’ll always remember to keep the streak going on, and it will also help you to grab the attention of people.</p><p><strong>Idea 2. Memorable Day</strong></p><p>We all have memorable days in our lives, like a milestone, graduation, or special event that we want to remember forever. What is a better way to commemorate them than with a Snap? Your friends and family will appreciate it, and you will be able to keep your streak alive for days to come.</p><p><strong>Idea 3. Streak While Traveling</strong></p><p>Whenever you are on a trip, travel to your office&#x2F;college, or head out to run some errands, remember to take a picture of the surroundings that look interesting and send it to whom you are establishing the streak.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/send-snapstreak-while-traveling.jpg"                      alt="send snapstreak while traveling"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-3-Organize-Your-Snapchat-And-Your-Time"><a href="#Tip-3-Organize-Your-Snapchat-And-Your-Time" class="headerlink" title="Tip 3. Organize Your Snapchat And Your Time"></a>Tip 3. Organize Your Snapchat And Your Time</h3><p>Are you trying to get the most out of Snapchat without letting it take over your life? Below we’ve provided some ideas to help you organize your time and your snaps.</p><p><strong>Idea 1. Edit the Name of your Snapchat Friends</strong></p><p>To avoid losing your Snapchat streaks with any of your contacts, you should start editing their names. Snapchat lists your most contacted friends at the top, so you might not see the others who are lower on your list. Editing their names to include something that will help you search for them will make it easier to avoid forgetting to send them a snap regularly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/edit-the-name-of-your-snapchat-friend.jpg"                      alt="edit the name of your snapchat friend"                ></p><p><strong>Idea 2. Pin Your Conversations</strong></p><p>If you want to keep someone at the top of your chat list, consider pinning their chat. This will also ultimately help you send snaps to them without breaking the streak.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/pin-conversation-in-snapchat.jpg"                      alt="pin conversation in snapchat"                ></p><p><strong>Idea 3. Stick to a Particular Time of the Day</strong></p><p>You will gain more by starting your Snapstreaks later on in the day, especially if you are only sending one snap per day. This way, the hourglass emoji will be visible for a considerable amount of time before it expires.</p><p><strong>Idea 4. Check Your Filters</strong></p><p>If you’re trying to keep up with multiple Snapstreaks at once, it’s easy to forget who you’re on a streak with. But there’s a way to see them without going to your list of friends.</p><p>Whenever you’re about to send a new snap, swipe through the filters. Here, you’ll see a special Snapchat streak filter, which will show how many consecutive days of successful streak you have in big white numbers next to the fire emoji.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>In this article, we’ve compiled a list of fun and creative <strong>Snapchat streak ideas</strong> to help you stay connected with your friends.</p><p>Hopefully, by following these tips, you can now keep your Snapchat streak alive and stay connected with your contacts in a better and more engaging way!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><h2 id="Fine-Tuning-Speed-Settings-for-Snapchat-Vids"><a href="#Fine-Tuning-Speed-Settings-for-Snapchat-Vids" class="headerlink" title="Fine-Tuning Speed Settings for Snapchat Vids"></a>Fine-Tuning Speed Settings for Snapchat Vids</h2><p>Snapchat is an instant messaging app that allows you to share your pictures and videos with your family members, friends, and colleagues.

Can I record a slow mo video in Snapchat?</strong></p><p>Technically speaking, no, you cannot. However, once you have recorded a video at a normal speed in Snapchat, you can apply the built-in Slow Motion filter to it by swiping the screen from left to right until you see the Snail icon at the center. The Snail icon represents the Slow Motion filter that reduces the playback speed when applied.</p><p><strong>2. Besides slow-motion, which speed filters does Snapchat have?</strong></p><p>In addition to <strong>slow motion Snapchat</strong> also has Forward and Fast Forward filters that increase the playback speed. While the Forward filter increases the speed slightly, the Fast Forward one enhances it drastically.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>When using an iPhone, even though the SLO-MO mode enables you to record footage in slow motion, you don’t get many options. Therefore, it would be safe to say that it is easy to slow down the speed of a video if you have a dedicated third-party post-production app. However, if you want to go for a convenient method, learning <strong>how to slow down a video on Snapchat</strong> is an extremely simple and straightforward process.</p><p>02 <a href="#part2">How to Record a Slo-Mo Video and Upload to Snapchat</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">How to Make Flash and Smooth Slo Mo Video for Snapchat</a></p><p>04 <a href="#part4">FAQs about Slowing Down Snapchat Video</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Add-Slow-Motion-Effects-to-Video-Using-the-Snapchat-App-1"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Add-Slow-Motion-Effects-to-Video-Using-the-Snapchat-App-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Add Slow Motion Effects to Video Using the Snapchat App"></a>Part 1: How to Add Slow Motion Effects to Video Using the Snapchat App</h2><p>Snapchat has a built-in Slow Motion filter that reduces the playback speed of a video when applied.

From the <strong>Memories</strong> screen, go to the <strong>Camera Roll</strong> tab, and tap to select the video that you recorded in the previous step.</p><p>Next, optionally, tap the <strong>Edit</strong> icon from the bottom-left corner to decorate the video and&#x2F;or add annotations to it, and follow the process as explained in the previous section to share the clip with your family, friends, or colleagues, or publish it as your story.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upload-iphone-slow-motion-video-snapchat.jpg"                      alt="upload iphone slow motion video snapchat"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Make-Flash-and-Smooth-Slo-Mo-Video-for-Snapchat-3"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Make-Flash-and-Smooth-Slo-Mo-Video-for-Snapchat-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Make Flash and Smooth Slo Mo Video for Snapchat"></a>Part 3: How to Make Flash and Smooth Slo Mo Video for Snapchat</h2><p>Although iPhone has the built-in SLO-MO mode that even enables you to set your preferred framerate and zoom level before recording, it still doesn’t allow you to slow down different parts of a video in different speed at your convenience. You can either record the entire video in slow motion or at a normal speed.</p><p>This is where a third-party app comes into play. While there are several video editing programs available online, the one of the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >best slow motion apps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that helps you slow down the portions of a video with precision is CapCut.</p><p>Downloading and installing CapCut on your iPhone or Android phone is simple, and once it is done, you can follow the process given below to learn <strong>how to slow things down on Snapchat</strong>:</p><p>With CapCut, you can either slow down the whole clip or manage the speed for different segments. This section explains both methods.</p><p><strong>Method 1: Slow Down the Whole Clip with CapCut</strong></p><p><strong>Step 1: Get to the Speed Panel</strong></p><p>Launch CapCut, import the video that you want to slow down, and tap the imported media in the <strong>Timeline</strong>. Next, tap <strong>Speed</strong> from the bottom of the interface to get to the next window.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/capcut-speed-option.jpg"                      alt="capcut speed option"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Reduce the Speed of the Video</strong></p><p>Tap <strong>Normal</strong> from the bottom of the screen that appears next, and drag the <strong>Speed</strong> slider to the left to reduce the playback speed. Tap <strong>OK</strong> from the bottom-right corner to save the changes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-capcut-speed-slow-motion.jpg"                      alt="change capcut speed slow motion"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Upload the Video to Snapchat</strong></p><p>Back on the previous interface, optionally tap <strong>Volume</strong> from the bottom and reduce the slider to <strong>0</strong> to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >mute the audio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of the footage as it may get distorted due to the reduction in the speed.</p><p>Next, tap <strong>Share</strong> from the top-right corner to save the video on your iPhone, and then use the method explained in the previous section to access the clip from the <strong>Gallery</strong> within Snapchat for uploading.</p><p><strong>Method 2: Reduce the Playback Speed of Different Parts of a Video</strong></p><p><strong>Step 1: Get to the Speed Panel</strong></p><p>Use the process described in the previous method to get to the <strong>Speed</strong> panel.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Reduce the Speed of Different Parts of the Video</strong></p><p>Tap <strong>Curve</strong> from the bottom of the interface. On the next screen, tap <strong>Custom</strong> from the lower area, and then tap <strong>Edit</strong>. From the next panel, drag the beat points down to reduce the speed (or drag them above the line to increase).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/capcut-curve-speed-custom-edit.jpg"                      alt="capcut curve speed custom edit"                ></p><p>Notice that each beat point represents a particular section of the video, and dragging it down reduces the playback speed of that segment. You can even tap anywhere on the line to add a new beat point and drag it down as needed for more precise speed management. Once done, tap <strong>OK</strong> from the bottom-right corner to save the modifications.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adjust-speed-velocity-capcut.jpg"                      alt="adjust speed velocity capcut"                ></p><p>Optionally, you can also tap any of the available presets on the Curve screen to reduce the playback speed of the video accordingly.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Upload the Video to Snapchat</strong></p><p>Use the method explained in the previous method to export the video, upload it to Snapchat, and share the clip with your family, friends, and colleagues, or publish it as your story.</p><h2 id="Part-4-FAQs-about-Slowing-Down-Snapchat-Video-3"><a href="#Part-4-FAQs-about-Slowing-Down-Snapchat-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: FAQs about Slowing Down Snapchat Video"></a>Part 4: FAQs about Slowing Down Snapchat Video</h2><p><strong>1. Can I record a slow mo video in Snapchat?</strong></p><p>Technically speaking, no, you cannot. However, once you have recorded a video at a normal speed in Snapchat, you can apply the built-in Slow Motion filter to it by swiping the screen from left to right until you see the Snail icon at the center. The Snail icon represents the Slow Motion filter that reduces the playback speed when applied.</p><p><strong>2. Besides slow-motion, which speed filters does Snapchat have?</strong></p><p>In addition to <strong>slow motion Snapchat</strong> also has Forward and Fast Forward filters that increase the playback speed. While the Forward filter increases the speed slightly, the Fast Forward one enhances it drastically.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>When using an iPhone, even though the SLO-MO mode enables you to record footage in slow motion, you don’t get many options. Therefore, it would be safe to say that it is easy to slow down the speed of a video if you have a dedicated third-party post-production app. However, if you want to go for a convenient method, learning <strong>how to slow down a video on Snapchat</strong> is an extremely simple and straightforward process.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"
