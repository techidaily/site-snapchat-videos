Streak While Traveling</strong></p><p>Whenever you are on a trip, travel to your office&#x2F;college, or head out to run some errands, remember to take a picture of the surroundings that look interesting and send it to whom you are establishing the streak.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/send-snapstreak-while-traveling.jpg"                      alt="send snapstreak while traveling"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-3-Organize-Your-Snapchat-And-Your-Time"><a href="#Tip-3-Organize-Your-Snapchat-And-Your-Time" class="headerlink" title="Tip 3. Organize Your Snapchat And Your Time"></a>Tip 3. Organize Your Snapchat And Your Time</h3><p>Are you trying to get the most out of Snapchat without letting it take over your life? Below we’ve provided some ideas to help you organize your time and your snaps.</p><p><strong>Idea 1. Edit the Name of your Snapchat Friends</strong></p><p>To avoid losing your Snapchat streaks with any of your contacts, you should start editing their names. Snapchat lists your most contacted friends at the top, so you might not see the others who are lower on your list. Editing their names to include something that will help you search for them will make it easier to avoid forgetting to send them a snap regularly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/edit-the-name-of-your-snapchat-friend.jpg"                      alt="edit the name of your snapchat friend"                ></p><p><strong>Idea 2. Pin Your Conversations</strong></p><p>If you want to keep someone at the top of your chat list, consider pinning their chat. This will also ultimately help you send snaps to them without breaking the streak.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/pin-conversation-in-snapchat.jpg"                      alt="pin conversation in snapchat"                ></p><p><strong>Idea 3. Stick to a Particular Time of the Day</strong></p><p>You will gain more by starting your Snapstreaks later on in the day, especially if you are only sending one snap per day. This way, the hourglass emoji will be visible for a considerable amount of time before it expires.</p><p><strong>Idea 4. Check Your Filters</strong></p><p>If you’re trying to keep up with multiple Snapstreaks at once, it’s easy to forget who you’re on a streak with. But there’s a way to see them without going to your list of friends.</p><p>Whenever you’re about to send a new snap, swipe through the filters. Here, you’ll see a special Snapchat streak filter, which will show how many consecutive days of successful streak you have in big white numbers next to the fire emoji.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>In this article, we’ve compiled a list of fun and creative <strong>Snapchat streak ideas</strong> to help you stay connected with your friends.</p><p>Hopefully, by following these tips, you can now keep your Snapchat streak alive and stay connected with your contacts in a better and more engaging way!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><h2 id="Take-Your-TeamSnap-Game-to-the-Next-Level-Expert-Tips"><a href="#Take-Your-TeamSnap-Game-to-the-Next-Level-Expert-Tips" class="headerlink" title="Take Your TeamSnap Game to the Next Level: Expert Tips"></a>Take Your TeamSnap Game to the Next Level: Expert Tips</h2><p>The trend of using vibrant filters and lenses during the pandemic time was first introduced by Snap Camera.

It’s a filter that will morph a person’s photo or video into an anime character and will customize the anime face based on the person’s facial features. So, rather than simply applying a generic image on top of your face, Snapchat makes sure that the anime image looks similar to your actual image. And as a result, each person’s anime face turns out to be different.</p><p>Since the hashtag #animefilter is trending, you can also apply the anime filter on your face and be a part of the trend. The reaction to this filter is lowkey amazing because the filter not only changes your face and makes it look like a part of a hit anime cartoon series or movie, but it sometimes also changes your hair color making you look like the King of the Pirates or Rapunzel. What this lens will do and how your image will turn out to be is highly fascinating.</p><p>What stands out is that after the <strong>anime</strong> <strong>filter</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>Snapchat</strong> was released, it has been used over 3 billion times. Snapchat has confirmed this statistic in its Third Quarter 2020 Financial report, and they even said that they already knew it would be a massive hit.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2111964/7443" target="_top" id="2111964">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2111964" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2111964/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Get-the-Anime-Filter-on-Snapchat"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Get-the-Anime-Filter-on-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Get the Anime Filter on Snapchat?"></a>Part 2: How to Get the Anime Filter on Snapchat?</h2><p>Now that you know how popular the <strong>Snapchat anime filter</strong> is. It’s worth knowing how to get it. Although this filter is available on Snapchat, many users are facing issues finding it. This section will show you two easy ways to get this filter. You can use one or both methods and start using the filter to show the world how you will look like an anime character. Here are the two ways:</p><h3 id="Method-1-Get-the-Anime-Face-Filter-on-Snapchat-via-Link"><a href="#Method-1-Get-the-Anime-Face-Filter-on-Snapchat-via-Link" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Get the Anime Face Filter on Snapchat via Link"></a>Method 1: Get the Anime Face Filter on Snapchat via Link</h3><p><strong>Step 1:</strong>  First, click on the link <a class="link"   href="https://www.snapchat.com/unlock/?type=SNAPCODE&uuid=ff9460034fee44a08e9a4282560cce36&metadata=01" >here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. You will need this link to get the anime face filter.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong>  Once you click on the click, a pop-up window will open. If you haven’t downloaded the anime filter yet, then Snapchat will say, “New lens found.” Right below it, you will see the message “unlock for 48 hours.” Go ahead and click on that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/unlock-anime-filter-for-48-hours.jpg"                      alt="Unlock the snapchat anime filter"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118323/7443" target="_top" id="2118323">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118323" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118323/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Step 3:</strong>  By clicking on the purple button, your <strong>Snapchat anime</strong> filter will be available for use for 48 hours.</p><p>Here’s a pro tip, if you want to continue using this filter, once the 48 hours are over, simply repeat the steps, and you can use it for additional 48 hours. Simple!</p><p>If the pop-up says, “nothing to see here”, which means you have the filter already. In this case, you can go to Snapchat and click the filter accordingly.</p><h3 id="Method-2-Get-the-Anime-Style-Filter-via-Explore-on-Snapchat"><a href="#Method-2-Get-the-Anime-Style-Filter-via-Explore-on-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Get the Anime Style Filter via Explore on Snapchat"></a>Method 2: Get the Anime Style Filter via Explore on Snapchat</h3><p>If you don’t want to click any unknown links, you can explore the anime filter by searching on Snapchat.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong>  Make sure your Snapchat is up-to-date. If not, update it to the latest version.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong>  Open Snapchat on your mobile or tablet, whichever you are using. Now, turn the lens towards you or someone else as if you are clicking a picture.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong>  Now, click on the smiley face filter button, and tap on the Explore button to continue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/explore-anime-style-filter-snapchat.jpg"                      alt="Explore the snapchat anime filter"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037350/7443" target="_top" id="2037350">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037350" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037350/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Step 4:</strong>  You can now search for Anime Styles. There are several anime filters available, just make sure that the creator of the filter is Snapchat.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong>  Once you have the anime filter, you can record a video of yourself, or take photos. You may also use both back and front cameras to turn anyone into an anime character.</p><p><strong>Pro tip:</strong>  This filter works on already saved photos and videos as well. Try them on too. This filter will work only on your face, though. So, it won’t turn your entire body into an anime character.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Do-I-Get-More-Filters-on-Snapchat"><a href="#Part-3-How-Do-I-Get-More-Filters-on-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How Do I Get More Filters on Snapchat?"></a>Part 3: How Do I Get More Filters on Snapchat?</h2><p>Since Snapchat keeps coming up with attractive filters, you may wonder how you can get more filters to keep using them. Well, there are a few tricks that you can try. We will explain these tricks in detail, so make sure to follow them correctly.</p><h3 id="Trick-1-Turn-on-Snapchat-Geofilters"><a href="#Trick-1-Turn-on-Snapchat-Geofilters" class="headerlink" title="Trick 1: Turn on Snapchat Geofilters"></a>Trick 1: Turn on Snapchat Geofilters</h3><p>Before you try using Snapchat geofilters, you will first have to permit Snapchat to access your location. Whether you are using iOS or Android, enable location, and you will start seeing geofilters and all the other filters that you have saved.</p><p>Don’t expect a plethora of filters to suddenly turn up. For example, when you apply a geofilter, you will see that it adds an illustration and the place name to your Snap. So, the more you explore and go out, the more filters you will start seeing.</p><h3 id="Trick-2-Check-Online-Resources-on-Lens-Studio-and-Lenslist"><a href="#Trick-2-Check-Online-Resources-on-Lens-Studio-and-Lenslist" class="headerlink" title="Trick 2: Check Online Resources on Lens Studio and Lenslist"></a>Trick 2: Check Online Resources on Lens Studio and Lenslist</h3><p>You can also explore two filter libraries, which are Lens Studio and Lenslist. These are repositories of AR content. These two libraries have many attractive filters. All you need to do is scan the Snapcode available in the filters and unlock them. Both of them will have duplicate filters as well, though. But dig a bit deeper, and you will have enough codes of filters to keep using them every day. You will find these codes in your profile once you add them.</p><h3 id="Trick-3-Share-Snapcodes-for-Snapchat"><a href="#Trick-3-Share-Snapcodes-for-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="Trick 3: Share Snapcodes for Snapchat"></a>Trick 3: Share Snapcodes for Snapchat</h3><p>The last way to add Snapcode of filters is by scanning other people’s codes. Once you go to your profile, you will see your Snapcodes, which other people can scan. Just like that, you can scan other people’s code as well. Some codes will be available for 24 hours, while others for 48 hours. After that, you can scan the code again when you want to reuse them. To scan a code, just hold your camera over the code and allow the screen to register it.</p><h2 id="Bonus-How-to-Add-Anime-Effect-to-Video-with-Filmora"><a href="#Bonus-How-to-Add-Anime-Effect-to-Video-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Bonus: How to Add Anime Effect to Video with Filmora"></a>Bonus: How to Add Anime Effect to Video with Filmora</h2><p>As we shared, Snapchat will only morph your face into an anime character.

The Snapchat emojis themselves include stars, hearts, faces and more.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1"><strong>Part1: What do exactly the Snapchat emojis mean?</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part2"><strong>Part2: How to change the streak emojis on Snapchat</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part3"><strong>Part3: How to get a Bitmoji on Snapchat</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part4"><strong>Part4: Why to use Snapchat emojis</strong></a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-What-do-exactly-the-Snapchat-emojis-mean"><a href="#Part-1-What-do-exactly-the-Snapchat-emojis-mean" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What do exactly the Snapchat emojis mean?"></a>Part 1: What do exactly the Snapchat emojis mean?</h2><p>In this section, we will tell you all about the different emojis on Snapchat. If you’ve been wondering what the Snap emoji meanings actually are, read on. A Gold Star next to someone’s name means they have replaced your snaps during the past 24 hours. A Yellow Star means you are #1 best friends with one another. You will send your largest amount of snaps to them and vice versa.</p><p>A Red Heart snap emoji is used to say that you have been #1 Bfs for a fortnight without interruption, whilst a Pink Heart Snapchat best friend emoji tells that that this has been the case for two months. If you see a baby emoji, this means you have only recently become friends with the person.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snapchat-emojis.JPG"                      alt="snapchat emojis"                ></p><p>Have you seen a Face with Sunglasses? This means the person is B.Fs with one of your best friends and you send plenty of snaps to someone that they send many snaps to. A Grimacing Face tells you that your #1 is also their #1 friend and that the person you send the most snaps to is the same person they send the vast majority of their snaps to.</p><p>The Smirking Face shows that you are one of their B.Fs without this being reciprocated. In other words, they send you many snaps but you don’t return the favor. A Smiling Face means that you are good friends with someone but they aren’t quite your #1 B.F.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115916/19272" target="_top" id="2115916">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115916" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115916/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-change-the-streak-emojis-on-Snapchat"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-change-the-streak-emojis-on-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to change the streak emojis on Snapchat"></a>Part 2: How to change the streak emojis on Snapchat</h2><p>If you’re not happy with the emojis that you are seeing or you feel that they are not accurate for the person in question, don’t worry – these can easily be changed.

The platform first appeared way back in September and has attracted millions upon millions of users since then. Snapchat may be strongly associated with teenagers, but it is used by adults of all ages. When you use Snapchat, the content you share is more direct and personal and is only seen by the people you want to see it, for ten seconds only. Snapchat is great for privacy, and if anyone attempts to take a screenshot of your content you will be notified.</p><p>Another reason so many people use Snapchat is that there are no complex settings to leave you confused. It also simplifies the video calling process and makes it much less complicated than other video communication platforms. Snapchat has also become a major marketing tool for businesses around the world, allowing them to connect with and promote their services to a wider range of tech-loving users.</p><p><strong>You may also like:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Add Emojis to Videos on YouTube&#x2F;Facebook&#x2F;Snapchat [Step by Step Guide] &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105860/7443" target="_top" id="2105860">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105860" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105860/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>More and more people are using Bitmoji to change the emojis on Snapchat.

In this section, you can learn <strong>how to send snaps from the camera roll</strong> without capturing a live snap. For this, we will explain some manual methods as well as some reliable apps in a detailed manner.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Using-a-Snapchat-Filter"><a href="#Method-1-Using-a-Snapchat-Filter" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Using a Snapchat Filter"></a>Method 1: Using a Snapchat Filter</h3><p>Snapchat allows you to apply its filters on any of your camera roll’s pictures. By selecting a particular photo or video from your memories or snap, you can instantly add a filter to them. Afterward, you can send the filtered image to your friends as a regular snap. However, this solution has a significant drawback that you must know. The limitation is that the receiver of the snap would be able to see that the sent picture is from the camera roll.</p><p>Step1 Open your Snapchat and swipe up to open the ‘Memories’. Go to your Camera Roll and select any particular picture from there.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/send-snaps-from-camera-roll-1.jpg"                      alt="access camera roll tab"                ></p><p>Step2 After choosing a particular photo, tap on the “<strong>Edit</strong>“ icon at the bottom left corner. You can apply filters to the photo by swiping from right to left. Keep swiping until you can find your preferred filter.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/send-snaps-from-camera-roll-2.jpg"                      alt="tap on edit option"                ></p><p>Step1 Once you have applied the filter to the photo, touch on the “Send To” button. Choose any Snapchat friend to whom you want to send the picture. Next, hit the “Send” icon again to send the photo successfully.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/send-snaps-from-camera-roll-3.jpg"                      alt="tap on send to button"                ></p><h3 id="Method-2-Using-a-Sticker"><a href="#Method-2-Using-a-Sticker" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Using a Sticker"></a>Method 2: Using a Sticker</h3><p>If you want to make your camera roll picture funny and entertaining, you can add stickers to it.

In this section, you can learn <strong>how to send snaps from the camera roll</strong> without capturing a live snap. For this, we will explain some manual methods as well as some reliable apps in a detailed manner.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Using-a-Snapchat-Filter-1"><a href="#Method-1-Using-a-Snapchat-Filter-1" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Using a Snapchat Filter"></a>Method 1: Using a Snapchat Filter</h3><p>Snapchat allows you to apply its filters on any of your camera roll’s pictures. By selecting a particular photo or video from your memories or snap, you can instantly add a filter to them. Afterward, you can send the filtered image to your friends as a regular snap.

Go to your Camera Roll and select any particular picture from there.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/send-snaps-from-camera-roll-1.jpg"                      alt="access camera roll tab"                ></p><p>Step2 After choosing a particular photo, tap on the “<strong>Edit</strong>“ icon at the bottom left corner.

For example, if you’re sharing a story about your company’s history, you could use a title card at the beginning of each section to identify the different parts of the story.</p><p>For this, you can take a snap of a wall or perhaps block your camera to get a black screen and then paste your text on the picture. You can also play with the font size, style, or color to create engaging title cards.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/title-cards-for-snapchat-stories.jpg"                      alt="title cards for snapchat stories"                ></p><h3 id="Idea-2-Adding-Music-To-Your-Video"><a href="#Idea-2-Adding-Music-To-Your-Video" class="headerlink" title="Idea 2.

With a maximum limit of 10 seconds, these videos are kept short in duration. Whether posting the <strong>Snapchat video</strong> to the story, sharing it with friends or in a Snapchat group, Snapchat was always a hit until numerous competitors started ripping its features.</p><p> But, Snapchat is back with a bounce with its multi snaps feature which is a new addition to video sharing feature in Snapchat. What is a multi snap? Snapchat, allows users to make more than 10 seconds snap video now, which is called multi snaps.</p><p> In this feature, you can record footages as long as 1 minute, which is divided into 6 snaps. Do you know how to make a video on Snapchat?

So, the more you explore and go out, the more filters you will start seeing.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1982456">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982456.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1982456">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982456.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1982456%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1982456/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Trick-2-Check-Online-Resources-on-Lens-Studio-and-Lenslist"><a href="#Trick-2-Check-Online-Resources-on-Lens-Studio-and-Lenslist" class="headerlink" title="Trick 2: Check Online Resources on Lens Studio and Lenslist"></a>Trick 2: Check Online Resources on Lens Studio and Lenslist</h3><p>You can also explore two filter libraries, which are Lens Studio and Lenslist.

Both of them will have duplicate filters as well, though. But dig a bit deeper, and you will have enough codes of filters to keep using them every day.

Featuring an anti-screenshot notification system that automatically notifies posters when a recipient or audience member screenshots a snap, it’s become increasingly harder to screenshot without being detected.</p><p>That being said, there are still plenty of other methods that offer a practical alternative to ensure you avoid that awkward automated notification.</p><h4 id="Option-1-Use-Another-Phone-or-Mobile-Device-to-Take-Snapchat-Screenshot"><a href="#Option-1-Use-Another-Phone-or-Mobile-Device-to-Take-Snapchat-Screenshot" class="headerlink" title="Option 1. Use Another Phone or Mobile Device to Take Snapchat Screenshot"></a>Option 1. Use Another Phone or Mobile Device to Take Snapchat Screenshot</h4><p>An easy and risk-free way to capture and store a specific snap with ease, utilizing another mobile device or camera is a great method that requires very little effort. Simply us a second phone, or a nearby tablet, to record the whole duration of the video or photo.</p><p>Although the quality of the recording won’t be as crisp and clear as it appears on the handheld, this is a reliable and fool-proof way to preserve those special snaps. From those video recordings, you should then be able to crop out the video or image you needed.</p><p>Missed it?</p><p>Why not take advantage of Snapchat’s “replay” mode to ensure you get the perfect shot – but be warned, posters also get notified of this too.</p><h4 id="Option-2-Use-the-Built-In-Screen-Recoding-Tool-on-iOS11"><a href="#Option-2-Use-the-Built-In-Screen-Recoding-Tool-on-iOS11" class="headerlink" title="Option 2. Use the Built-In Screen Recoding Tool on iOS11"></a>Option 2. Use the Built-In Screen Recoding Tool on iOS11</h4><p>If you didn’t already know, there’s a built-in screen recording software within iOS11 that allows you to effectively capture and record snaps with ease. Lying within the Settings of any iPhone, follow these easy steps on how to live record your screen:</p><ul><li>Step 1: Head to Settings &gt; Control Centre &gt; Customize Controls</li><li>Step 2: Locate the “Screen Recording” functionality</li><li>Step 3: Select the small cross to add it to your Control Centre</li><li>Step 4: To activate – Tap the icon with the 2 concentric circles to start recording. To complete a recording, simply tap the red bar that’s present at the top of the screen and select “End Recording”.</li></ul><p>Although it’s not possible to start recording a snap whilst it’s already open, it’s best to start recording before you opt to open a specific message.</p><p>Please note: If you have updated to Snapchat version 10.17.5, the posters will be notified each and every time you initiate and capture a recording through the use of this built-in recorder.</p><h4 id="Option-3-Use-QuickTime-Screen-Capture-on-a-Mac"><a href="#Option-3-Use-QuickTime-Screen-Capture-on-a-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Option 3. Use QuickTime Screen Capture on a Mac"></a>Option 3. Use QuickTime Screen Capture on a Mac</h4><p>A little more technical than simply using another mobile device to record a snap, using the QuickTime Player is an efficient and high-quality method for those looking to secretly store a snapchat post.</p><p>To start recording snaps, follow these simple steps:</p><ul><li>Step 1: Connect your iPhone to your Mac</li><li>Step 2: Open the QuickTime Player application</li><li>Step 3: Select <strong>File &gt; New Movie Recording</strong> from the menu</li><li>Step 4: Once loaded, simply hover the mouse beside the recording button. By clicking the small arrow, you’ll be provided with a range of different recording options</li><li>Step 5: Select your Phone as the <strong>Movie Recording Input</strong></li></ul><p>Once connected, your Mac screen should now be mirroring your mobile device. Just like you would on your phone, simply hit record and head on over to the Snapchat application to begin recording.</p><h4 id="Option-4-Use-the-Mirror-Feature-for-Android"><a href="#Option-4-Use-the-Mirror-Feature-for-Android" class="headerlink" title="Option 4. Use the Mirror Feature for Android"></a>Option 4. Use the Mirror Feature for Android</h4><p>Similar to the use of QuickTime or the iOS11 Screen Recording software, Screen Mirroring is another effective method for capturing Snapchat screenshots without the poster being made aware. By connecting a HDMI cable to both your TV and laptop, or by accessing the “Screen Mirroring” application that’s often built-in to most Smart Phones and Android devices, it’s possible to mirror&#x2F;cast the active screen on your device onto an external platform.</p><p>In doing so, you’re presented with the opportunity to utilize another device to record a playing snap or even share a recently received snap with other audience members that are present in the room.</p><h4 id="Option-5-Delay-the-Snapchat-Screenshot-Notification"><a href="#Option-5-Delay-the-Snapchat-Screenshot-Notification" class="headerlink" title="Option 5. Delay the Snapchat Screenshot Notification"></a>Option 5. Delay the Snapchat Screenshot Notification</h4><p>A method for those feeling a more confident or even for those that aren’t too bothered about their posters receiving a notification in the long run, this method is a great way to delay the arrival of that pop-down notification.</p><p>To delay the notification process, follow these simple steps:</p><ul><li>Step 1: Load the Snapchat application on your mobile device</li><li>Step 2: Find the snap you want to open&#x2F;record (ensure it is fully loaded)</li><li>Step 3: Turn off WiFi, Bluetooth, Mobile Data</li><li>Step 4: Turn on the Airplane Mode</li><li>Step 5: Open the snap and take your screenshot</li><li>Step 6: Wait approximately 30 seconds and then turn all your connections back on</li></ul><p>Designed to postpone the process of the poster receiving a notification, but not allowing for viewers to screenshot undetected, this method allows audience members to screenshot snaps from those that are perhaps a little unobservant when it comes to checking their notifications.</p><p>Be warned though, some posters may catch on to this method of screenshotting and they may stop sharing their videos and images with you.</p><!-- affiliate

href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>Despite there being plenty of reasons why there might be a need for you to record a Snapchat memory without the sender being made aware, it’s important to note that this can also be viewed as a breach of privacy with senders not only being informed of who has taken a screenshot, but also how many times they’ve done so and of which post.</p><p>With Snapchat designed to maintain the notion that any media sent between users is considered temporary, thanks to the 5-10 second duration limit, the methods listed above, although not fail-proof, are suggested as simple yet effective ways to avoid triggering an unwanted notification whilst using this highly popular social networking application.</p><p><a

The good news is that two new Snapchat tools have been released – the <strong>Lens Studio</strong> and Create Your Own Lens applications.</p><p>If you are a regular Snapchat user, you may want to learn about the Snapchat lens and how it can help you. We will help you get started. Here is our step by step guide on how to make Snapchat lenses.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1"><strong>Part1: Comparing Lens Studio and Creating Your Own Lens</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part2"><strong>Part2: How to Use Lens Studio</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part3"><strong>Part3: How to Create Snapchat Lenses Using Create Your Own Lens</strong></a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-Comparing-Lens-Studio-and-Creating-Your-Own-Lens"><a href="#Part-1-Comparing-Lens-Studio-and-Creating-Your-Own-Lens" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Comparing Lens Studio and Creating Your Own Lens"></a>Part 1: Comparing Lens Studio and Creating Your Own Lens</h2><p>The two programs that we are highlighting today are Lens Studio and Create Your Own Lens. These are both fantastic programs for creating your own Snapchat lens, but they do have slightly different uses. If you are the type of person who wants to design a professional Snapchat lens, you are going to prefer Lens Studio.</p><p>But if you are hoping to come up with something creative that you can share with your friends and family, then you may love Create Your Own Lens. It is a very easy program to use, and it offers a ton of features that you may be surprised to see.</p><h4 id="Snapchat-lenses-is-for-fun"><a href="#Snapchat-lenses-is-for-fun" class="headerlink" title="Snapchat lenses is for fun"></a>Snapchat lenses is for fun</h4><p>The beauty of Snapchat lenses is that you can now create your own environment, which you can use each time you are taking photos or videos. Sure, you can always use the filters that are already available in the application, but not everyone would find those enough.</p><p>If you want some customization, or you just want to mess around until you get the filter that makes sense for you, Snapchat lenses are the way to go.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Lens-Studio.JPG"                      alt="lens studio"                ></p><h4 id="Lens-Studio-is-for-business"><a href="#Lens-Studio-is-for-business" class="headerlink" title="Lens Studio is for business"></a>Lens Studio is for business</h4><p>Lens Studio is perfect for businesses that may want to create unique environments for their clients, or the times when they are releasing company Snapchat posts. Say the company is hosting an event. They may want a custom graphic for that event, which is used for all the pictures and videos posted to Snapchat about the event. Using Lens Studio lets them do that with ease.</p><p>Create Your Own Lens is great when you are going to a special event, birthday party or graduating, and you want a special graphic that comes up in all your snaps. It is very intuitive to use, and is available through the App Store as a download.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/len-studio-snapchat.JPG"                      alt="lens studio snapchat"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134246/18498" target="_top" id="2134246">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134246" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134246/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Use-Lens-Studio"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Use-Lens-Studio" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Use Lens Studio"></a>Part 2: How to Use Lens Studio</h2><h4 id="1-Download-Lens-Studio"><a href="#1-Download-Lens-Studio" class="headerlink" title="1. Download Lens Studio"></a>1. Download Lens Studio</h4><p>The first step involves downloading Lens Studio, which you can do from your computer. It is compatible with both Windows and Mac computers, and will run on any semi-modern system. According to the Snapchat team, Lens Studio is similar to the program used by their AR teams to create lenses. That means you are getting similar functionality, but with an easier to manage interface.</p><h4 id="2-Choose-Templates-Page"><a href="#2-Choose-Templates-Page" class="headerlink" title="2. Choose Templates Page"></a>2. Choose Templates Page</h4><p>It is normal to feel a little overwhelmed the first time you try and use this program. But that is why the templates page is so great. You can select from templates depending on the type of lens that you are hoping to create. You can just use a template, or you can incorporate your own ideas to customize the template.</p><p>There is also a Lens Studio Overview guide that you can access online, which will help you get acquainted with the program’s various features and quirks.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lens-studio-templates.JPG"                      alt="lens studio templates"                ></p><h4 id="3-Use-Studio-Panels"><a href="#3-Use-Studio-Panels" class="headerlink" title="3. Use Studio Panels"></a>3. Use Studio Panels</h4><p>Are you ready to create your own custom Snapchat lens? It is time to head over to Studio Panels on the application. This is the area where you can add your own 2D or 3D objects, and you can visualize how they would look as a Snapchat filter. You can add, remove, resize and drag objects to specific areas of the screen.</p><p>There are other tools accessible from the Resources panel. You can use these tools to ensure that your Snapchat lens is exactly as you want.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lens-studio-panal.JPG"                      alt="lens studio panel"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082542/7443" target="_top" id="2082542">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082542" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082542/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h4 id="4-Preview-the-Snapchat-Lens-You-Create"><a href="#4-Preview-the-Snapchat-Lens-You-Create" class="headerlink" title="4. Preview the Snapchat Lens You Create"></a>4. Preview the Snapchat Lens You Create</h4><p>The great thing about this application is that you can preview the lens before you send it out to your phone. When you are satisfied with the image on the preview, you can pair your phone with the application, and you will be able to send that Snapchat lens onto your phone through your Snapcode. It is that simple!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/preview-snapchat.JPG"                      alt="preview lens studio"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082533/7443" target="_top" id="2082533">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082533" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082533/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Create-Snapchat-Lenses-Using-Create-Your-Own-Lens"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Create-Snapchat-Lenses-Using-Create-Your-Own-Lens" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Create Snapchat Lenses Using Create Your Own Lens"></a>Part 3: How to Create Snapchat Lenses Using Create Your Own Lens</h2><ol><li>There are two ways that you can access the tool for creating fun Snapchat lenses. You can either visit the website snapchat.com&#x2F;create, or you can go on the “filters and lenses” section on your iOS device. If you are using Snapchat on an Android device, you will only have the option for the website. But the feature is coming to the Android version of Snapchat very soon.</li><li>When you are in the application or on the website, you may start to look at the different templates for Snapchat lenses. Now you can add other items into the templates, such as photographs, text or graphics.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-snapchat.JPG"                      alt="create snapchat"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2043617/7443" target="_top" id="2043617">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2043617" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2043617/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>It is all up to your imagination. You can create the perfect Snapchat lens, which you can then send into your Snapchat account through your Snapcode. Of course, if you are using your iOS device to create the lens, it is already linked to your account.</p><p>Another cool feature is how you can set the location for where the Snapchat lens is available. Say you are hosting a party. You can have the Snapchat lens available to everyone who uses Snapchat within a set square footage of your home.
