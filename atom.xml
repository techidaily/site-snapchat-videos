Through the following steps, you can learn <strong>how to save snaps to the camera roll</strong> all at once:</p><p>Step1 Open your Snapchat and swipe up from the bottom using your finger. This will open all the captured snaps on your screen.</p><p>Step2 Now tap and hold any specific snap that will allow you to select multiple snaps.

From there, select the “Settings” icon to proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/save-snaps-to-camera-roll-8.jpg"                      alt="open snapchat settings"                ></p><p>Step2 On the settings menu, locate the option called “Memories.” Now on the new menu, select the “Save Button” given under the section of “Save Destinations.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/save-snaps-to-camera-roll-9.jpg"                      alt="choose the save button option"                ></p><p>Step3 In the Save Button menu, you can easily choose to save your photos to Camera Roll or Memories only. Or you can select the “Memories and Camera Roll” option to save the snaps on both memories and camera roll. Through these settings, you can change the location of saved snaps effortlessly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/save-snaps-to-camera-roll-10.jpg"                      alt="select your snapchat snap location"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Are you fond of using Snapchat regularly?

It is a very easy program to use, and it offers a ton of features that you may be surprised to see.</p><h4 id="Snapchat-lenses-is-for-fun"><a href="#Snapchat-lenses-is-for-fun" class="headerlink" title="Snapchat lenses is for fun"></a>Snapchat lenses is for fun</h4><p>The beauty of Snapchat lenses is that you can now create your own environment, which you can use each time you are taking photos or videos. Sure, you can always use the filters that are already available in the application, but not everyone would find those enough.</p><p>If you want some customization, or you just want to mess around until you get the filter that makes sense for you, Snapchat lenses are the way to go.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Lens-Studio.JPG"                      alt="lens studio"                ></p><h4 id="Lens-Studio-is-for-business"><a href="#Lens-Studio-is-for-business" class="headerlink" title="Lens Studio is for business"></a>Lens Studio is for business</h4><p>Lens Studio is perfect for businesses that may want to create unique environments for their clients, or the times when they are releasing company Snapchat posts. Say the company is hosting an event. They may want a custom graphic for that event, which is used for all the pictures and videos posted to Snapchat about the event. Using Lens Studio lets them do that with ease.</p><p>Create Your Own Lens is great when you are going to a special event, birthday party or graduating, and you want a special graphic that comes up in all your snaps. It is very intuitive to use, and is available through the App Store as a download.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/len-studio-snapchat.JPG"                      alt="lens studio snapchat"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/947746/11832" target="_top" id="947746">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-947746" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/947746/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Use-Lens-Studio"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Use-Lens-Studio" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Use Lens Studio"></a>Part 2: How to Use Lens Studio</h2><h4 id="1-Download-Lens-Studio"><a href="#1-Download-Lens-Studio" class="headerlink" title="1. Download Lens Studio"></a>1. Download Lens Studio</h4><p>The first step involves downloading Lens Studio, which you can do from your computer. It is compatible with both Windows and Mac computers, and will run on any semi-modern system. According to the Snapchat team, Lens Studio is similar to the program used by their AR teams to create lenses. That means you are getting similar functionality, but with an easier to manage interface.</p><h4 id="2-Choose-Templates-Page"><a href="#2-Choose-Templates-Page" class="headerlink" title="2. Choose Templates Page"></a>2. Choose Templates Page</h4><p>It is normal to feel a little overwhelmed the first time you try and use this program. But that is why the templates page is so great. You can select from templates depending on the type of lens that you are hoping to create. You can just use a template, or you can incorporate your own ideas to customize the template.</p><p>There is also a Lens Studio Overview guide that you can access online, which will help you get acquainted with the program’s various features and quirks.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lens-studio-templates.JPG"                      alt="lens studio templates"                ></p><h4 id="3-Use-Studio-Panels"><a href="#3-Use-Studio-Panels" class="headerlink" title="3. Use Studio Panels"></a>3. Use Studio Panels</h4><p>Are you ready to create your own custom Snapchat lens? It is time to head over to Studio Panels on the application. This is the area where you can add your own 2D or 3D objects, and you can visualize how they would look as a Snapchat filter. You can add, remove, resize and drag objects to specific areas of the screen.</p><p>There are other tools accessible from the Resources panel. You can use these tools to ensure that your Snapchat lens is exactly as you want.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lens-studio-panal.JPG"                      alt="lens studio panel"                ></p><h4 id="4-Preview-the-Snapchat-Lens-You-Create"><a href="#4-Preview-the-Snapchat-Lens-You-Create" class="headerlink" title="4. Preview the Snapchat Lens You Create"></a>4. Preview the Snapchat Lens You Create</h4><p>The great thing about this application is that you can preview the lens before you send it out to your phone. When you are satisfied with the image on the preview, you can pair your phone with the application, and you will be able to send that Snapchat lens onto your phone through your Snapcode. It is that simple!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/preview-snapchat.JPG"                      alt="preview lens studio"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Create-Snapchat-Lenses-Using-Create-Your-Own-Lens"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Create-Snapchat-Lenses-Using-Create-Your-Own-Lens" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Create Snapchat Lenses Using Create Your Own Lens"></a>Part 3: How to Create Snapchat Lenses Using Create Your Own Lens</h2><ol><li>There are two ways that you can access the tool for creating fun Snapchat lenses. You can either visit the website snapchat.com&#x2F;create, or you can go on the “filters and lenses” section on your iOS device. If you are using Snapchat on an Android device, you will only have the option for the website. But the feature is coming to the Android version of Snapchat very soon.</li><li>When you are in the application or on the website, you may start to look at the different templates for Snapchat lenses. Now you can add other items into the templates, such as photographs, text or graphics.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-snapchat.JPG"                      alt="create snapchat"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137212/26400" target="_top" id="2137212">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137212" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137212/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>It is all up to your imagination. You can create the perfect Snapchat lens, which you can then send into your Snapchat account through your Snapcode. Of course, if you are using your iOS device to create the lens, it is already linked to your account.</p><p>Another cool feature is how you can set the location for where the Snapchat lens is available. Say you are hosting a party. You can have the Snapchat lens available to everyone who uses Snapchat within a set square footage of your home.

Snapchat was the first social networking platform to introduce the concept of daily stories which was widely adopted by other instant messengers as well including Instagram and WhatsApp. Since it is a mobile-oriented platform, you need to create and edit your videos in a certain way to make sure they are the best fit for Snapchat.</p><p>You May Also Like: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >The Ultimate Guide of Snapchat Filters <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="What-Are-the-Ideal-Features-of-a-Snapchat-Video"><a href="#What-Are-the-Ideal-Features-of-a-Snapchat-Video" class="headerlink" title="What Are the Ideal Features of a Snapchat Video?"></a>What Are the Ideal Features of a Snapchat Video?</h2><p>Snapchat is highly optimized for vertical viewing which means that all the content needs to be served in portrait aspect ratio instead of landscape used by YouTube and other video platforms. You need to ensure that every aspect of your video is perfect before you can upload it for Snapchat on Mac. Here are some of the key features that you must not forget.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/snapchat.jpg"                                     ></p><ul><li><strong>Resolution</strong> - The ideal resolution of a Snapchat video is <strong>1080 x 1920</strong> pixels which is known as full HD. This resolution will ensure that your video loads in the right way and remains sharp and crisp for an excellent viewing experience.</li><li><strong>Video Format</strong> - The recommended video format for Snapchat clips is <strong>MP4 and MOV. Y</strong>ou can use either of those formats on your Mac.</li><li><strong>Aspect Ratio</strong> - This is one of the key aspects of any video that determines the orientation of viewing. For a perfect Snapchat video, it is recommended that you keep the aspect ratio to <strong>9:16</strong>.</li><li><strong>Video Length Size</strong> - Remember that Snapchat isn’t like YouTube and serves an audience that wants micro-entertainment. This is why the recommended time for your video is <strong>3 to 10 seconds</strong> with the video size <strong>not exceeding 32 MB</strong>. Otherwise, the Snapchat audience may not respond well to your videos.</li></ul><p>That is why it is crucial that your Snapchat video has all the ideal features so your audience can enjoy the viewing experience as intended instead of attempting to manipulate their phones to be able to see the video clearly. It will create an unpleasant and frustrating experience and your viewers might not stay with you.</p><h2 id="How-to-Adjust-the-Video-for-Snapchat-on-Mac-Step-by-Step"><a href="#How-to-Adjust-the-Video-for-Snapchat-on-Mac-Step-by-Step" class="headerlink" title="How to Adjust the Video for Snapchat on Mac?

With the innovative features that Snapchat offers, you could do so much more. That is what a private story is all about. If you have had an interesting incident or occurrence, wish to showcase an experience, or tell a little more about yourself, it is best expressed with a private story.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Private stories on this platform are easy to create <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and share with anyone who is on your friends’ list. You could add as many or as few as you would like who can see the story you create. The tag of <strong>Snapchat private story name ideas</strong> would mean that you are sharing something intimate and showcasing some precious moments or memories. These could also be a capture of emotions or some moments that were meaningful to you or to someone. You could create such a story, share it with your friend or friends, and delete them any time you want.

Its lenses and filters are quite popular and dominating in the selfie game all around us. These filters can be a lot of fun, from changing your hairstyle to changing your background.</p><p>Snapchat offers its users almost every type of filter you can imagine. Nearly half a million filters are created every single month, which are perfectly working. From kids to grown-ups, everyone uses these filters for fun, to make themselves look weird, cool, or just a bit nicer. Snapchat has plenty of lenses and cool filters, making people fall in love with the app. People can also create their filters and help them engage with their brands and businesses. Let’s explore some of the best Snapchat filters of 2021!</p><h2 id="Part-1-Most-Popular-Snapchat-Filters-for-Selfies-in-2021"><a href="#Part-1-Most-Popular-Snapchat-Filters-for-Selfies-in-2021" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Most Popular Snapchat Filters for Selfies in 2021"></a>Part 1: Most Popular Snapchat Filters for Selfies in 2021</h2><p><strong>Let’s have a look at the most popular Snapchat filters for selfies as we all know there’s a big range to choose from!</strong></p><h4 id="1-Fire-Sunglasses"><a href="#1-Fire-Sunglasses" class="headerlink" title="1.  Fire Sunglasses"></a>1.  Fire Sunglasses</h4><p>Whenever the users are feeling energetic and motivated, they use the “fire sunglasses” filter. They want to show everyone that they’re on fire, and there couldn’t be a better filter than this. It provides the users with a pair of glasses with fire on the glass, which adds to the energy.</p><p>The fire on the contacts gives you a fiery and relaxed look that catches people’s attention. People can use it after their workouts or for motivational posts. This filter puts up an uplifting mood and gives you good vibes, but it might not be best suited for everyone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snapchat-fire-glasses-filter-lens.jpg"                      alt="Most popular Snapchat filters - Fire Sunglasses "                ></p><h4 id="2-Neon-Horns"><a href="#2-Neon-Horns" class="headerlink" title="2.  Neon Horns"></a>2.  Neon Horns</h4><p>The Classic filter, the devil’s horn but in neon! Incredibly catchy to the eye and gives you a devilish look. This filter is a classic and is here to stay for a long time; there’s no doubt in that.</p><p>For the first time, Horn Filters have taken one step further and given it a neon effect, making it even more appealing. The user can change the horn color; various options have been offered, such as black and white. Some more color options include lime green, magenta, orange, and light blue. It is an evergreen filter but has limited use. Want to know the best part? It sits perfectly according to your filter and does not glitch at all.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/neon-horns-snapchat-filters.jpg"                      alt="Most popular Snapchat filters - Neon Horns "                ></p><h4 id="3-Cartoon-3D-Style"><a href="#3-Cartoon-3D-Style" class="headerlink" title="3.  Cartoon 3D Style"></a>3.  Cartoon 3D Style</h4><p>Cartoon 3D Style, one of the most popular filters on Snapchat and has every right to be! It gives you that unique specific animated look making you look like you just stepped out of a Disney movie. This filter adjusts itself according to our face cut and turns into Disney cartoons such as Kristoff.</p><p>People love to fool around with funny filters, and this one here has to be the best of them all. It gets better: from children to adults, everyone has undoubtedly used this filter. This filter has a soft shading giving it that artistic look like it had been hand-drawn; it’s pretty fun when you make different faces with the filter on your face. This makes it the best filter on Snapchat!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snapchat-cartoon-3d-filter-lens.jpg"                      alt="Most popular Snapchat filters - Cartoon 3D Style "                ></p><h4 id="4-Scary-Mask"><a href="#4-Scary-Mask" class="headerlink" title="4.  Scary Mask"></a>4.  Scary Mask</h4><p>When people get bored from typical filters and don’t get much response, they use funny or scary filters, which are way more fun. But here’s the kicker: this filter covers half your face with a golden skull mask and turns your eyes into a golden flame color too. If we look at this from a different perspective, this can also spread awareness to wear masks during these challenging times. This filter has received so much response from the Snapchat users and finds a place in the “best filters on Snapchat” list!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snapchat-scary-mask-filter.jpg"                      alt="Most popular Snapchat filters - Scary Mask "                ></p><h4 id="5-Lips-Freckles"><a href="#5-Lips-Freckles" class="headerlink" title="5.  Lips Freckles"></a>5.  Lips Freckles</h4><p>This is the perfect filter for you whenever you’re in the mood to give or take some love. It applies lips freckles near your eye and cheek area, making them look like there are freckles. You can even send these pictures to your loved ones and see how happy they get. Stuff like this is best when shared, especially with your loved ones, and experience some mutual good vibes.</p><p>Even when you feel lonely, it will bring you closer to the people far away from you, and you can even keep these memories safe with both of you. Isn’t that great? This filter proves to be one of the best Snapchat filters for selfies.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lips-freckles-filter-snapchat.jpg"                      alt="Most popular Snapchat filters - Lips Freckles "                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Best-Snapchat-Filters-and-Lens-You-Should-Try-In-2021"><a href="#Part-2-Best-Snapchat-Filters-and-Lens-You-Should-Try-In-2021" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Best Snapchat Filters and Lens You Should Try In 2021"></a>Part 2: Best Snapchat Filters and Lens You Should Try In 2021</h2><p>Snapchat filters are not just from developers, but there are some default filters on Snapchat too. These filters are mostly in use more than the ones by developers.</p><h3 id="Best-Snapchat-Filters-from-Developers"><a href="#Best-Snapchat-Filters-from-Developers" class="headerlink" title="Best Snapchat Filters from Developers"></a>Best Snapchat Filters from Developers</h3><h4 id="1-Vogue-Noir"><a href="#1-Vogue-Noir" class="headerlink" title="1.  Vogue Noir"></a>1.  Vogue Noir</h4><p>It’s everyone’s dream to be a model, but not everyone can be one! The least you can do is try this filter on yourself and look classy. What makes this filter so special is that it gives you that 1980’s look. It turns your picture into a black and white image, and you can also change and control the vogue logo color. This filter makes you look like a Vogue Magazine cover model.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vogue-noir-filter-snapchat.jpg"                      alt="Most popular Snapchat filters and lens -Vogue Noir "                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134246/18498" target="_top" id="2134246">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134246" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134246/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h4 id="2-Polaroid-Frame"><a href="#2-Polaroid-Frame" class="headerlink" title="2.  Polaroid Frame"></a>2.  Polaroid Frame</h4><p>This filter has to be one of the best filters on Snapchat. Moreover, it turns your picture into a polaroid, and we all know how good a polaroid looks. This filter brightens up your photo and applies a few filters which make your face soften up. It also mentions the day and date at the bottom; the writing is handwritten, making it even more attractive.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/polaroid-frame-filter.jpg"                      alt="Most popular Snapchat filters and lens -Polaroid Frame "                ></p><h4 id="3-Pecan"><a href="#3-Pecan" class="headerlink" title="3.  Pecan"></a>3.  Pecan</h4><p>This filter is for all the pale people out there. This filter adds strength to your skin and gives you a textured filter without going too far. This filter comes with two options; with grain and without grain, and most people prefer it with grain. Furthermore, this filter gives you those cool summer vibes.

Snapchat is a way to restrict the people who can see the story. Snapchat provides options on <strong>how to make a private story on Snapchat</strong> and share the same to a select few. With such a feature you have more control over who sees the content you publish. A Snapchat private story is easy to create, the only difference is how you send the video or story across to the people you choose. You can do so on the Snapchat application on an Android as well as on an iOS device. Here we explore how such a story can be created and published or posted privately.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snapchat-name-ideas.jpg"                      alt="Snapchat Name Ideas"                ></p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What Is a Private Story on Snapchat?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: How to Create a Private Story on Snapchat?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: Creative Private Story Names and Ideas for Snapchat</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: Troubleshooting Tips: When Someone Hide Their Snapchat Stories from You</a></li></ul><h2 id="What-Is-a-Private-Story-on-Snapchat"><a href="#What-Is-a-Private-Story-on-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="What Is a Private Story on Snapchat?"></a>What Is a Private Story on Snapchat?</h2><p>Stories are a term popular in Snapchat, to showcase images and videos for the last 24 hours. Stories can comprise photos as well as videos. You can post stories to your feed which you can view as well as your friends. These show your friends your different activities the day before. These exist for the next 24 hours within which you can replay them many times.</p><p>There is a difference between ‘My Stories’ and ‘Private Stories’. When you record and post a video or a photo on your Snapchat account publicly, it is seen by all your contacts. On the other hand, if you wish to post a private story, you need to create a custom story. After you create a custom story, you can then post the same as a private one. Here you select the ones who would view the story. You choose the contacts who would view the post before publishing it. Another aspect is that no one else can add content to the private stories you post on Snapchat.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1630055">                    <video width="192" height="320" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1630055.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18460-1630055">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1630055.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:120px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fcaperobbin.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1630055%2F18460'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1630055/18460"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Create-a-Private-Story-on-Snapchat"><a href="#How-to-Create-a-Private-Story-on-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="How to Create a Private Story on Snapchat?"></a>How to Create a Private Story on Snapchat?</h2><p>To begin how to make a private story on Snapchat, here are the steps to follow:</p><ul><li><a href="#part5">1.Log into Your Account.</a></li><li><a href="#part6">2.Visit Your Profile Page</a></li><li><a href="#part7">3.Select the Private Story option</a></li><li><a href="#part8">4.Create the Story</a></li><li><a href="#part9">5.Share with Your Select Friends</a></li></ul><h4 id="1-Log-into-Your-Account"><a href="#1-Log-into-Your-Account" class="headerlink" title="1.Log into Your Account"></a>1.Log into Your Account</h4><p>Start by logging in to your Snapchat account.

You can use someone else’s account to check if their stories are showing on their feed. You could also send a private snap to that person. If he or she answers the same quickly and yet, you do not get to see their stories that would mean that you are hidden contact in their list.</p><p>You could also ask a common friend if they have even received stories and updates from that person. If the person’s stories are reaching others but not you, that means that they have hidden their stories from you.</p><p><strong>Can You Hide Someone on Snapchat Without Them Knowing?</strong></p><p>If you wish to hide someone but in a way that they do not find out, try the new muting function. This allows you to mute certain friends without them realizing the same. The feature is called ‘Do Not Disturb’ and it allows you to mute conversations that are one on one or come from groups. The feature is a new addition and is a useful one. You need not hide or block any contact in this case but simply silence notifications of their updates.</p><p>To use this feature, all you need to do is tap on the group or the person you wish to silence. The popup menu would include ‘Settings’ and here you can select the option ‘Do Not Disturb’. You will not receive notifications from such conversations. However, you will still be able to access, check messages from such contacts as well as share your stories as well.</p><p>This feature is a useful addition and you need not hide or block a contact to silence conversations from them. Hence, those people will also not get notified unlike when you block a contact. It allows you to see updates from them at your ease and convenience.</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Snapchat is an attractive platform to get your daily moments the attention they deserve. You can create stories, private or with anyone else, and share them with selective people of your choice. The Snapchat private story option is great to keep your moments between your close friends or loved ones. Other features such as ‘Do Not Disturb’ allow you to silence notifications from friends or groups that you wish to check as per your convenience.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1934138/19272" target="_top" id="1934138">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1934138" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1934138/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Ollie Mattison</p><p>Ollie Mattison is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Ollie Mattison</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-preserving-your-snapchat-moments-beyond-app/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Preserving Your SnapChat Moments Beyond App</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-decoding-the-copyright-code-for-insta-musicians/"><u>[New] In 2024, Decoding the Copyright Code for Insta Musicians</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-preserve-and-organize-transforming-snaps-into-gallery-photos/"><u>[New] In 2024, Preserve and Organize Transforming Snaps Into Gallery Photos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-step-by-step-installed-vrecorder-software/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Step-by-Step Installed VRecorder Software</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-the-nvidia-method-to-perfect-gaming-replays/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved The NVIDIA Method to Perfect Gaming Replays</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-enhance-engagement-with-these-15-snap-insights/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Enhance Engagement with These 15 Snap Insights</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-the-definitive-guide-to-ios-and-android-maker-tools/"><u>[Updated] The Definitive Guide to iOS & Android Maker Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-blue-bands-promise-tips-for-longevity/"><u>2024 Approved The Blue Bands Promise Tips for Longevity</u></a></li><li><a href="https://technical-tips.techidaily.com/comprehensive-comparison-apples-ios-app-store-vs-google-play/"><u>Comprehensive Comparison: Apple's IOS App Store Vs.

In this era of digitalization, one can easily interact with friends on social media. With the emergence of social media, it has now become convenient to maintain social connections and support networks that otherwise wouldn’t have been possible. Social networking platforms have made staying connected with friends, family, and other acquaintances easier than ever.</p><p>Snapchat is one such platform that has gained immense popularity over recent years. A multimedia messaging app, it allows you to share pictures and videos with your friends and dear ones. The app lets you take snaps and apply filters and lenses to best express yourself. You can use the <strong>best Snapchat filters</strong> and lenses to add personality and whimsy to snaps.</p><p>Whether you want to have some fun with your friends or want to impress someone, Snapchat has amazing effects for every occasion. Indeed, Instagram’s story highlights have become one of the biggest social media platforms. However, by the end of June 2021, Snapchat claimed to have increased its global daily active users to 293 million.</p><p>Snapchat’s lenses and filters have become so famous that Instagram has mimicked the feature. But, there’s a reason why snaps are regularly circulating outside Snapchat - the fantastic creative effects give it a leg up over Instagram. Snapchat’s extensive collection of funny lenses, cool filters, and stunning beauty filters makes it way better than Instagram’s.</p><p>Wondering how to find good face modifiers from a sea of clones out there? Relax! Our team at Wondershare has done the hard work and made a list of the best filters and lenses on Snapchat. But, first, let’s have a detailed insight into the best Snapchat filters and lenses.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What Are the Differences Between Snapchat Filters and Lenses?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: 20 Best Filters &amp; Lenses On Snapchat to Use in 2021</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: FAQs About Snapchat Filters &amp; Lenses</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-What-Are-the-Differences-Between-Snapchat-Filters-and-Lenses"><a href="#Part-1-What-Are-the-Differences-Between-Snapchat-Filters-and-Lenses" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Are the Differences Between Snapchat Filters and Lenses?"></a>Part 1: What Are the Differences Between Snapchat Filters and Lenses?</h2><p>Snapchat filters are static overlays and sit on the top of your photo or video. In contrast, Snapchat lenses are dynamic, augmented reality animations that alter your voice along with your appearance as you move on the screen. Unlike filters that are added after taking a photo, lenses are displayed while you’re taking the photo.</p><p>The best filters on Snapchat let you change a snap’s tint or change the direction or speed in which your video is played back. On the other hand, Snapchat lenses work by utilizing facial recognition software to track your features and apply an animation that follows your facial movements. While lenses can change the sound of your voice and the appearance of your face, filters can only add color tones, messages, customized images, and icons to your snaps.</p><p>The photo and video sharing app allow you to make your own filters and lenses. Creating a filter on Snapchat isn’t free as you will have to pay a certain amount based on the filter’s square foot. However, when it comes to making your own Snapchat lens, you won’t have to pay any fees as the entire process is free.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2043594/7443" target="_top" id="2043594">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2043594" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2043594/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-20-Best-Filters-Lenses-On-Snapchat-to-Use-in-2021"><a href="#Part-2-20-Best-Filters-Lenses-On-Snapchat-to-Use-in-2021" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 20 Best Filters &amp; Lenses On Snapchat to Use in 2021"></a>Part 2: 20 Best Filters &amp; Lenses On Snapchat to Use in 2021</h2><h3 id="Best-Snapchat-Filters-For-Selfies"><a href="#Best-Snapchat-Filters-For-Selfies" class="headerlink" title="Best Snapchat Filters For Selfies"></a>Best Snapchat Filters For Selfies</h3><p>Getting bored with the regular filters that add some brightness and little symbols to selfies?
