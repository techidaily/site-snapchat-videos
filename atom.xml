These <strong>Snapchat emojis</strong> don’t simply remain the same forever, but instead change over the course of time, and the changes themselves are based on the way that you interact with your friend. Only you are able to see the emojis. The Snapchat emojis themselves include stars, hearts, faces and more.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1"><strong>Part1: What do exactly the Snapchat emojis mean?</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part2"><strong>Part2: How to change the streak emojis on Snapchat</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part3"><strong>Part3: How to get a Bitmoji on Snapchat</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part4"><strong>Part4: Why to use Snapchat emojis</strong></a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-What-do-exactly-the-Snapchat-emojis-mean"><a href="#Part-1-What-do-exactly-the-Snapchat-emojis-mean" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What do exactly the Snapchat emojis mean?"></a>Part 1: What do exactly the Snapchat emojis mean?</h2><p>In this section, we will tell you all about the different emojis on Snapchat. If you’ve been wondering what the Snap emoji meanings actually are, read on. A Gold Star next to someone’s name means they have replaced your snaps during the past 24 hours. A Yellow Star means you are #1 best friends with one another. You will send your largest amount of snaps to them and vice versa.</p><p>A Red Heart snap emoji is used to say that you have been #1 Bfs for a fortnight without interruption, whilst a Pink Heart Snapchat best friend emoji tells that that this has been the case for two months. If you see a baby emoji, this means you have only recently become friends with the person.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snapchat-emojis.JPG"                      alt="snapchat emojis"                ></p><p>Have you seen a Face with Sunglasses? This means the person is B.Fs with one of your best friends and you send plenty of snaps to someone that they send many snaps to. A Grimacing Face tells you that your #1 is also their #1 friend and that the person you send the most snaps to is the same person they send the vast majority of their snaps to.</p><p>The Smirking Face shows that you are one of their B.Fs without this being reciprocated. In other words, they send you many snaps but you don’t return the favor. A Smiling Face means that you are good friends with someone but they aren’t quite your #1 B.F.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068426/7443" target="_top" id="2068426">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068426" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068426/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-change-the-streak-emojis-on-Snapchat"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-change-the-streak-emojis-on-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to change the streak emojis on Snapchat"></a>Part 2: How to change the streak emojis on Snapchat</h2><p>If you’re not happy with the emojis that you are seeing or you feel that they are not accurate for the person in question, don’t worry – these can easily be changed.

The platform first appeared way back in September and has attracted millions upon millions of users since then. Snapchat may be strongly associated with teenagers, but it is used by adults of all ages. When you use Snapchat, the content you share is more direct and personal and is only seen by the people you want to see it, for ten seconds only. Snapchat is great for privacy, and if anyone attempts to take a screenshot of your content you will be notified.</p><p>Another reason so many people use Snapchat is that there are no complex settings to leave you confused. It also simplifies the video calling process and makes it much less complicated than other video communication platforms. Snapchat has also become a major marketing tool for businesses around the world, allowing them to connect with and promote their services to a wider range of tech-loving users.</p><p><strong>You may also like:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Add Emojis to Videos on YouTube&#x2F;Facebook&#x2F;Snapchat [Step by Step Guide] &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>More and more people are using Bitmoji to change the emojis on Snapchat.

Snapchat photos, videos, and stories of contacts vanish from storyboard right after you view them.</p><p> So, what will you do to save photos or videos from your friends’ Snapchat or Snap Stories long before they are gone? You can take a screenshot, save in flight mode, use your computer, or an app to capture the videos and images.</p><p> Through this article, we are going to tell you, how to save Snapchats to your phone to make you watch them later.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1"><strong>Part1: How to Save Snapchats without them knowing</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part2"><strong>Part2: How to save Snapchat videos on Mac</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part3"><strong>Part3: How to save Snapchat videos on Android</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part4"><strong>Part4: How to save Snapchat videos to your Phone</strong></a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Save-Snapchats-without-them-knowing"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Save-Snapchats-without-them-knowing" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Save Snapchats without them knowing"></a>Part 1: How to Save Snapchats without them knowing</h2><p> You want to save a friend’s Snaps, but Snapchat immediately alerts them of the screen shot taken. Hence, it is not possible to save other’s pictures or videos in Snapchat in incognito mode. You don’t need apps to save Snapchat to your phone. There is hardly a feasible way to do so without the senders’ knowledge. In such a situation, you can try out the following option – saving Snaps in flight mode.</p><p> Here are the steps</p><ol><li>First of all, launch the Snapchat app on your mobile phone and leave it open. Go to your phone’s ‘Settings’ (Android&#x2F;iPhone) and toggle on the ‘Airplane&#x2F;Flight’ mode. Airplane&#x2F;Flight mode disables all the wireless connections, be it network signals or internet related services for your device (Wi-Fi as well as cellular).</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snapchat-save-without-knowing.JPG"                      alt="snapchat save without knowing"                ></p><ol start="2"><li>Browse the Snapchat inbox and view the desired Snap that you wish to save, and quickly take a screenshot. Make sure to be quick enough and do it before the Snap expires.</li><li>Now, logout from your Snapchat account right after taking the screenshot. You need to follow the logout process according to your device specific settings. Being in ‘Airplane&#x2F;Flight’ mode you can’t logout, but click the logout option anyway (this is vital!).</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snapchat-log-out.JPG"                      alt="snapchat log out"                ></p><ol start="4"><li>Here, you need to close the Snapchat app on your mobile phone by swiping out the Snapchat app (up&#x2F;sideways depending on Android&#x2F;iPhone) from your device’s force quit screen.</li><li>Toggle off the ‘Airplane&#x2F;Flight’ mode and wait until your phone connects to the Wi-Fi or mobile network. Now, launch the Snapchat app again and login with the same credentials. The Snaps you have taken screenshots of will still appear as unopened on the storyboard and your friend will have no clue about the Snap being screenshot.</li></ol><p> <strong>Read More to Get :</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Screenshot on Snapchat without Them Knowing &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-save-Snapchat-videos-on-Mac"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-save-Snapchat-videos-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to save Snapchat videos on Mac"></a>Part 2: How to save Snapchat videos on Mac</h2><p> After learning to take screenshots of Snaps using the ‘Airplane’ mode, how about saving Snapchat videos on your Mac computer? Yes, you can easily save Snapchat videos using your iPhone and Mac computer. The process involves recording your iPhone’s screen through your Mac as a movie and then saving it. Here is how to do it</p><ol><li>Take and connect your iPhone and Mac computer using a lightning cable. Make sure that they are pre-synced.

The service has launched several innovative features over the years and one of their latest and popular tools is cameos. It is a fun way that one can express themselves, with their own faces plastered on comic characters or on bodies of animals and so forth.</p><ol><li><strong>What is a Snapchat Cameo?</strong></li></ol><p>If you have been seeing your friends add their faces to fun emojis, cartoons, and other figures, you could do that too with this fun feature on Snapchat. A cameo is an option that allows you to add your face to comic characters or animals or even create funny videos with them. You become a star of looping, short videos that you can send across to your friends. It is a great way to express your emotions in moments. Instead of messages, <strong>Snapchat cameos</strong> are an innovative way to say hello, express your feelings, and so forth. It is possible to customize captions and add them to the cameos that you create.</p><p>These are easy to add and send in chat messages since it is an option that occurs next to the stickers. It is available on the apps created for Android and iOS devices. You can choose from more than 150 cameos which makes it a great feature.</p><p>Indeed, who would not want to have cool means to express themselves, their opinions, or tell their close friends what they feel? Snapchat offers several unique ways of expressing yourself. While you could attach videos or memes that express what you feel, with a cameo you can make that even more personalized and unique. Add your face to cool videos, animations, or pics. What’s more, you can add text in different fonts and with interesting effects. It is nothing short of creating a video by yourself. That too can be easily done in a matter of seconds, while you are on chat with your friends or loved ones.</p><ol><li><strong>How to Use Snapchat Cameo?</strong></li></ol><p>There are easy ways to get started when using <strong>Snapchat cameos</strong>. All you need is to tap on the button provided, on the sticker bar. It involves taking a selfie or choosing a picture or a video that you already have on your phone or tablet. If a friend has set up the feature in their Snapchat and is chatting live, it is possible to co-star in it together.</p><p>Here are simple ways to get started:</p><ul><li>Start by choosing a contact on the Snap list with whom you wish to start a conversation or want to send a pic or video using this feature. You will find the functionality while you are texting and adding effects to the conversation. For this reason, the function appears in the borders of the keyboard you use.</li><li>Once the chat page opens up, find the face icon next to the chat bar which shows above the keyboard. This leads to the emoji page along where you will find the <strong>Snapchat cameos</strong> option at the bottom.</li><li>You will find the cameo icon at the bottom of this section. It looks like a face with a + sign on it. This will lead you to create the cameo video or pic.</li><li>It starts by activating the selfie camera. It aligns the face on the camera with an outline in blue. It will instruct you to take the selfie picture.</li><li>You will then get options for adding filters to the cameo of your face. This can consist of pictures you have in your gallery or a repository of images and cartoons that the app provides. You could also source images from the internet or videos to use for this purpose.</li><li>Once the filters are applied and captions added, you are ready to send across the cameo to your selected contact. The <strong>Snapchat cameos</strong> you create get added to the chat option directly.</li><li>It is also possible to create a two-person cameo, especially if the person’s pics are available on your gallery of images. You can also add text to make the pics more expressive.</li></ul><ol><li><strong>How to Fix Snapchat Cameo Not Showing up?</strong></li></ol><p>Users of the Snapchat app can use cameo as one of the innovative new features that help them add their faces to funny videos, cartoons, and so forth. However, in certain instances, the cameos might not show up. In such cases you can fix such issues with the following steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Update App</strong></li></ul><p>This is a solution that might prove effective. You could opt for updating the app by downloading the latest version of the app from the Apple or Android app store. Once the app updates and installs, you might find that the issue is resolved. One could also use the beta version of the app available at online stores.</p><ul><li><strong>Check Settings on the Phone</strong></li></ul><p>This is another possible way to get the issue resolved. Visit the phone settings. Opt for the section on app management. Here search for the Snapchat app. Here you could opt to uninstall and use Force Stop. Visit storage options and clear all data. You can then restart your phone. Once you open the app you could find the cameo issue resolved.</p><ul><li><strong>Install VPN</strong></li></ul><p>There could be instances when the feature does not show up in the app due to the restrictions that countries impose. Users can install VPN in such an instance. This will then help resolve the issue. One could then reinstall the app and find the feature available on the app.</p><p>One of the above resolutions usually proves effective if you are unable to find <strong>Snapchat cameos</strong> on your app. If your phone or tablet is of an older version that does not support the app or you are using a simulator platform, you might not find this update in the version you use.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Here we understand what is the <strong>Snapchat cameos</strong> feature that one can find and how to use it. It is one of the new features that the social media service has introduced. It helps animate photos and videos with a selfie of the user. The photos and videos that the user creates with this feature can be easily shared with the contacts of the user. It is a feature that is easy to use on the app. One can get started by using their faces on the latest memes that they find on the internet. Here we also discuss the different ways one can resolve problems that arise when this feature does not show up on the app.</p><p>So go ahead and be creative with your expressions. You can add a light note to your messages, create funny pics and videos and bring about a comic look and feel to a conversation. It is also a great way to express how you feel without having to be serious about it. This is especially useful if you wish to let someone know how you feel but you are unsure of what their reactions would be.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AIMmjowaFs4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/Y5UmwDaI7HU/s250-c-k/photo.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Liza Brown</p><p>Liza Brown is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Liza Brown</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/new-audio-animation-for-dynamic-snapchat-films-for-2024/"><u>[New] Audio Animation for Dynamic Snapchat Films for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/updated-unrivaled-sonic-union-for-speakers-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Unrivaled Sonic Union for Speakers for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-how-to-get-snapchat-on-mac/"><u>2024 Approved How to Get Snapchat on Mac?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/approved-premier-cutting-suites-on-linux-systems/"><u>2024 Approved Premier Cutting Suites on Linux Systems</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-sound-painting-on-snapchat-shift-your-vocal-landscape-swiftly/"><u>2024 Approved Sound Painting on Snapchat Shift Your Vocal Landscape Swiftly</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/can-life360-track-or-see-text-messages-what-can-you-do-with-life360-on-apple-iphone-14-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>Can Life360 Track Or See Text Messages?

This feature has made the app popular with young people aged 13-34 who want to communicate without leaving a permanent record.</p><p>As of May 2022, Snapchat has <a class="link"   href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/545967/snapchat-app-dau/#:~:text=How%20many%20daily%20active%20users,increase%20of%20over%2018%20percent." >347 million daily active users. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> That’s impressive growth from its humble beginnings back in 2011. With <a class="link"   href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/272014/global-social-networks-ranked-by-number-of-users/" >monthly active users of 557 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, Snapchat is ranked as the 12th most popular social media platform.</p><p>Not only that, the number of <a class="link"   href="https://www.omnicoreagency.com/snapchat-statistics/" >Snapchat daily video views is 18 billion, <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> making it the best platform to showcase your services&#x2F;products and generate more income. However, all this is only possible with the right <strong>Snapchat marketing strategy.</strong></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1948876/19272" target="_top" id="1948876">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1948876" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1948876/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Why-Should-Business-Market-On-Snapchat"><a href="#Part-2-Why-Should-Business-Market-On-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Why Should Business Market On Snapchat"></a>Part 2. Why Should Business Market On Snapchat</h2><p>So you are probably thinking why your business should be on Snapchat - because it’s popular with teenagers and young adults. In fact, the platform has over 347 million daily active users, with <strong>75%</strong> being under the age of 34.</p><p>Therefore, if you’re targeting a younger demographic, then Snapchat should definitely be part of your social media marketing strategy.</p><p>Another big reason is that Snapchat is incredibly engaging. The average Snapchat user opens the app at least 20 times a day and spends 25 - 30 minutes on the app each day, so that’s a lot of potential exposure for your business.</p><p>Not only that, but since Snapchat is still a new field and opened up <a class="link"   href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/20/snapchat-messaging-app-ad-creepy-ouija" >ads to users in October 2014, <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> many big companies have not entered the market. This has created a huge opportunity for small businesses to market their products and generate leads to increase their sales.</p><p>With Snapchat, you can get discovered by users in their Discovery feeds or via Stories. Also, they can interact with your brand using the Geofilters, stickers, and lenses you’ve produced during your ad campaign.</p><p>For instance, Taco Bell created a filter for Cinco de Mayo. The filter received 224 Million views, which is insane. Nevertheless, this campaign kept users engaged and helped increase Taco Bell’s sales.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/taco-bell-cinco-de-mayo-filter-on-snapchat.jpg"                      alt="taco bell cinco de mayo filter on snapchat"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137227/26400" target="_top" id="2137227">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137227" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137227/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-Where-To-Start-Your-Snapchat-Marketing-Strategy"><a href="#Part-3-Where-To-Start-Your-Snapchat-Marketing-Strategy" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

This article will provide extensive details about how to know if someone blocked you on Snapchat, so, please read it till the end and do not miss any point. So let’s start.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pin-on-snapchat.jpg"                      alt="pin-on-snapchat"                ></p><h2 id="Introduction-of-how-to-know-if-someone-blocked-you-on-Snapchat"><a href="#Introduction-of-how-to-know-if-someone-blocked-you-on-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="Introduction of how to know if someone blocked you on Snapchat?"></a>Introduction of how to know if someone blocked you on Snapchat?</h2><p>It’s a real shame when your social media accounts are permanently disabled. Everyone in the modern world depends on social media to remain in touch. As a result, being blocked may be a devastating experience for a person’s mental health. In this guide, we are going to discuss how to know if someone blocked you on Snapchat?</p><p>Snapchat and other similar applications fail to inform you if your account has been blocked. I will let you know how to know if someone blocked you on Snapchat. So, you can keep your attention on the good things in life instead of the bad.</p><p>However, if you discover that how to know if someone blocked you on Snapchat, consider why this would be the case. If you’re having trouble messaging someone, don’t attempt to use several accounts. If you approach the situation calmly, you may learn why you were banned on Snapchat. Alternatively, the individual may have canceled your account or removed you from their list of Friends or Contacts.</p><p>A deleted account differs from a banned account in that it is no longer accessible.</p><h2 id="Blocked-vs-removed-What’s-the-difference"><a href="#Blocked-vs-removed-What’s-the-difference" class="headerlink" title="Blocked vs. removed: What’s the difference?"></a>Blocked vs. removed: What’s the difference?</h2><p>Snapchat’s blocking system differs from those other social media sites. The individual who is blocked won’t know if they’ve been blocked since they won’t know how to find out. Even if they are no longer friends, the guy who blocked them will seem to be. They’ll remain in your chat list and in your friend’s list, but they won’t be able to see any messages you send. You won’t even be able to access their blogs or other online information.</p><p>Being blocked on Snapchat, on the other hand, is a very other matter. This indicates that another person has unfriended you. Your most recent conversations with this individual may be hidden from view. You won’t see them on your buddy list, but you may search for them if you know the username.</p><h2 id="How-can-you-know-if-someone-on-Snapchat-has-banned-you"><a href="#How-can-you-know-if-someone-on-Snapchat-has-banned-you" class="headerlink" title="How can you know if someone on Snapchat has banned you?"></a>How can you know if someone on Snapchat has banned you?</h2><h3 id="1-Check-your-recent-chats-with-them"><a href="#1-Check-your-recent-chats-with-them" class="headerlink" title="1.Check your recent chats with them"></a>1.Check your recent chats with them</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/way1-check-your-recent-chats-with-them.png"                      alt="way1-check-your-recent-chats-with-them"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1915830/19272" target="_top" id="1915830">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1915830" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1915830/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>It’s possible that the other user deleted their account or was barred if your recent conversations don’t appear despite being preserved.</p><h3 id="2-Send-them-a-message-if-you-can"><a href="#2-Send-them-a-message-if-you-can" class="headerlink" title="2.Send them a message if you can"></a>2.Send them a message if you can</h3><p>You can snap someone you’ve spoken to in the past if you’ve previously interacted with them.

However, Snapchat marketing can be challenging, as the platform constantly evolves and changes.</p><p>This article provides an overview of <strong>Snapchat marketing strategy,</strong> including why businesses should market on this platform, what types of content to post, and how to measure results.</p><p>With the information available in this article, you will be able to create a strategy that works for your business and get succeeded.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/snapchat-app.jpg"                      alt="snapchat app"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Snapchat-Overview"><a href="#Part-1-Snapchat-Overview" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Snapchat Overview"></a>Part 1. Snapchat Overview</h2><p>Firstly, let’s have an overview of Snapchat before we see how to draw your blueprint in Part 3 and Part 4.</p><p>Snapchat - founded by Evan Spiegel, Bobby Murphy, and Reggie Brown - is a unique messaging app because it allows users to send disappearing messages and photos. This feature has made the app popular with young people aged 13-34 who want to communicate without leaving a permanent record.</p><p>As of May 2022, Snapchat has <a class="link"   href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/545967/snapchat-app-dau/#:~:text=How%20many%20daily%20active%20users,increase%20of%20over%2018%20percent." >347 million daily active users. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> That’s impressive growth from its humble beginnings back in 2011. With <a class="link"   href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/272014/global-social-networks-ranked-by-number-of-users/" >monthly active users of 557 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, Snapchat is ranked as the 12th most popular social media platform.</p><p>Not only that, the number of <a class="link"   href="https://www.omnicoreagency.com/snapchat-statistics/" >Snapchat daily video views is 18 billion, <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> making it the best platform to showcase your services&#x2F;products and generate more income. However, all this is only possible with the right <strong>Snapchat marketing strategy.</strong></p><h2 id="Part-2-Why-Should-Business-Market-On-Snapchat"><a href="#Part-2-Why-Should-Business-Market-On-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Why Should Business Market On Snapchat"></a>Part 2. Why Should Business Market On Snapchat</h2><p>So you are probably thinking why your business should be on Snapchat - because it’s popular with teenagers and young adults. In fact, the platform has over 347 million daily active users, with <strong>75%</strong> being under the age of 34.</p><p>Therefore, if you’re targeting a younger demographic, then Snapchat should definitely be part of your social media marketing strategy.</p><p>Another big reason is that Snapchat is incredibly engaging. The average Snapchat user opens the app at least 20 times a day and spends 25 - 30 minutes on the app each day, so that’s a lot of potential exposure for your business.</p><p>Not only that, but since Snapchat is still a new field and opened up <a class="link"   href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/20/snapchat-messaging-app-ad-creepy-ouija" >ads to users in October 2014, <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> many big companies have not entered the market. This has created a huge opportunity for small businesses to market their products and generate leads to increase their sales.</p><p>With Snapchat, you can get discovered by users in their Discovery feeds or via Stories. Also, they can interact with your brand using the Geofilters, stickers, and lenses you’ve produced during your ad campaign.</p><p>For instance, Taco Bell created a filter for Cinco de Mayo. The filter received 224 Million views, which is insane. Nevertheless, this campaign kept users engaged and helped increase Taco Bell’s sales.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/taco-bell-cinco-de-mayo-filter-on-snapchat.jpg"                      alt="taco bell cinco de mayo filter on snapchat"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Where-To-Start-Your-Snapchat-Marketing-Strategy"><a href="#Part-3-Where-To-Start-Your-Snapchat-Marketing-Strategy" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

While Facebook and Instagram have long been in the scene, new ones like TikTok and Snapchat are starting to pop up. If you are operating your business in the 21st century and still have not developed your presence in them, then, believe it or not, you are truly missing out on a whole lot of opportunities. But the million-dollar question is – what’s the difference between the two marketing channels from the perspective of an influencer and a marketer? The article here draws out the dissimilarities between the two for the brands to identify the most fitting potential marketing channel to promote themselves.</p><h2 id="Basic-Comparison-Between-TikTok-and-Snapchat"><a href="#Basic-Comparison-Between-TikTok-and-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="Basic Comparison Between TikTok and Snapchat"></a>Basic Comparison Between TikTok and Snapchat</h2><p>Before digging into the dissimilarities between the two apps, don’t you think it’s better to draw insight into them individually? The section here introduces both TikTok and Snapchat individually, highlighting interesting facts that might help you draw out the basic differences between the two social media networks.</p><p><strong>TikTok Fundamentals</strong></p><p>A very popular video-sharing app, launched by the Chinese multinational internet technology company ByteDance in 2017. By the end of 2018, it took the world by storm, especially in the USA. At the end of 2019, it generated 1.5 billion downloads from all around the world.</p><p>Regarding its purpose, it was tailored to entertain users with short, looping, mostly humorous videos. If you are looking for a platform to showcase your talent with choreographed dance numbers, reaction videos, lip-syncing, and a potent participant of hashtag challenge, TikTok is the ideal platform to open up.</p><p>Popular mostly among the Gen-Z audience, 49% of whom hail from the age cohort 13-16, it once again proves its competitiveness in the list of social media networks. As per advertising is concerned, it’s mostly in the form of branded filters, takeovers, top view ads, hashtag challenges, in-feed native video ads, and influencer brand partnerships.</p><p><strong>Snapchat Fundamentals</strong></p><p>A mobile messaging app ideal for sharing both visual, and textual content, including videos, photos and texts. Unlike TikTok, it’s relatively old and was launched back in the year 2011.</p><p>Contrary to TikTok, Snapchat does not just allow users to keep pace with the current trend but also connect with buddies over Stories and other ephemeral content. It’s empowering both users and brands with abilities to showcase creativity through 3D environment interactions, object scanning, and try-on effects.</p><p>Regarding its target audience, they are mostly the millennials, 218 million of whom fall into the list of active users. From a marketing perspective, it permits brands to promote themselves through shoppable ads, branded filters, personalized targeting, AR lenses, and Snap Ad.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Basic Difference</strong></th><th><strong>TikTok</strong></th><th><strong>Snapchat</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>App Type</strong></td><td>Video-sharing app</td><td>Mobile messaging app</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Usage</strong></td><td>For the sake of Entertainment</td><td>Connecting with friends and updating oneself to the latest trends</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Audience</strong></td><td>Gen-Z</td><td>Millennials</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Advertising</strong></td><td>CPM (Cost Per Thousand Impressions) basis</td><td>Snap Ad, Shoppable ads, Personalized Targeting &amp; Native Checkout</td></tr></tbody></table><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2137393/7443" target="_top" id="2137393">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2137393" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2137393/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="TikTok-vs-Snapchat-What-Influencers-Need-to-Know"><a href="#TikTok-vs-Snapchat-What-Influencers-Need-to-Know" class="headerlink" title="TikTok vs. Snapchat: What Influencers Need to Know"></a>TikTok vs. Snapchat: What Influencers Need to Know</h2><p>Wondering what’s an Influencer? Well, it’s someone you hire to promote your organization’s products when you fail to reach out to a wider audience. The person entrusted with the responsibilities of marketing your brand will ensure the flooding in of more followers for greater exposure. It’s a concept similar to social media influencers that you would find in both TikTok and Snapchat.</p><p>From the stance of an Influencer, here are 5 differences between the two apps.</p><ul><li><strong>Core Features</strong></li></ul><p>Influencers tend to look for features for creating a gripping visual content. TikTok ushers a quite a few of them, including video capture, filter effects, sound library, impressive editing tools, creation prompts and a ‘For You’ page, where the discovery feed based on algorithm is available.</p><p>On the contrary, Snapchat features similar such tools but with the only difference being in the count. You will find here more options besides video capture and editing tools, these being text and video chat, AR Lenses, Story creation, Discover tab, image capture, and Snap Maps.</p><ul><li><strong>Type of Users</strong></li></ul><p>While in TikTok, you will mostly find the celebrities, renowned brands and content creators to flood the social media platform; in Snapchat, the crowd mostly comprises of publishers.</p><ul><li><strong>Demographic</strong></li></ul><p>Mostly Gen-Z occupies the crowd in TikTok, majority of whom belong to the age group 18-24. However, Snapchat is mostly dominated by millennials.</p><ul><li><strong>Active Users</strong></li></ul><p>The relatively new app of TikTok happens to attract fewer active users, accounting 41 million globally, whereas Snapchat enjoys the presence of 218 million population daily.</p><ul><li><strong>Downloads</strong></li></ul><p>Probably because TikTok is new to people that 738 million of them have downloaded the app from all around the world in the year 2019 itself. However, Snapchat recorded 75 million globally in the same year.</p><p>An influencer observes all the above statistics before choosing to go for the preferred social media network.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1899850">                    <video width="486" height="864" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1899850.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14483-1899850">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1899850.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:304px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Felectronicx.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1899850%2F14483'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1899850/14483"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="TikTok-vs-Snapchat-What-Marketers-Should-Know"><a href="#TikTok-vs-Snapchat-What-Marketers-Should-Know" class="headerlink" title="TikTok vs. Snapchat: What Marketers Should Know"></a>TikTok vs. Snapchat: What Marketers Should Know</h2><p>Sometimes, marketers seem to put all their energy into an app without realizing the level of effectiveness it would generate. The same holds for TikTok and Snapchat. So, it’s always wise to walk through the pros and cons of both, seek out the contrasting points from the perspective of certain key indicators and then decide. If you are here wondering where to start your advertising campaign from, go through the points below to make an informed decision.</p><ul><li><strong>Content Marketing</strong></li></ul><p>Go for the TikTok app, if you are targeting the Gen-Z population and currently undergoing budget constraints. With inclusions of hashtags and keywords, you can optimize the video content, attract your target audience, and build a community around you. However, it’s not a very promising app for directing traffic to your website as the social media network allows only a few brands to share the link of their created videos in the website content.</p><p>On the contrary, Snapchat is the most favorable app among brands seeking a platform to launch short, bite-sized videos to promote a newly-launched product and gain admiration from both Gen-Z and millennials. And the best thing? You can always draw online traffic to your website through them and generate greater conversions.</p><ul><li><strong>Marketing Opportunities</strong></li></ul><p>Lucrative opportunities await the small businesses investing their time and energy in TikTok because the platform being relatively new, sets limited norms on what makes content engaging and what fails to achieve it. Moreover, it’s a great spot to test the waters before going widespread with your products over other social media networks.</p><p>Snapchat, on the contrary, is most suitable for mid-sized and large-scale companies because it lacks the perspective of free content creation. However, plenty of advertising alternatives are floating up for brands to leverage, which is why most of the companies are now investing more in it than other advertising channels. Moreover, it enables all business users to share links of created content on websites that TikTok fails to cover.</p><p>Put simply, Snapchat promises more marketing opportunities to businesses that have ample funds whereas TikTok favors those who are pressed for money. But, speaking of brand-friendliness, the latter welcomes more experiments than prior.</p><ul><li><strong>User Base &amp; Behavior</strong></li></ul><p>Prior to launching a promotional campaign, don’t you think it’s prudent to grab an idea about the user base in each app? Of course, otherwise, you will be landing with the wrong audience and gradually fail to generate enough conversions.</p><p>Believe it or not, but reports claim that Snapchat is home to 210 million active users daily, whereas TikTok to 800 million every month. Though both the apps attract millennials and Gen-Z users, launching your ad campaign in the prior will mean more exposure of your products to a vast audience, 61% of whom are female. However, if you are focusing more on men, TikTok will a great platform to start with because 56% of the global male audience is its active users.</p><p><strong>What to Choose?</strong></p><p>Thankfully, we now have an answer to the most sought-after debate of TikTok vs. Snapchat! If you are seeking a platform that’s more stable and widely used up by the general population, Snapchat should be your go-to app. In the past, it has offered better ROI (Return on Investment) to brands choosing to reach out to their target audience through it. And, with ad offerings on the rise here, it’s certainly more approachable to brands. But, let’s not disregard TikTok because it’s in the nascent stage. Let’s not forget that it’s a great platform to run experiments and observe the reactions of Gen-Z before reaching out to millennials. The ball is in your court now.

From there, proceed to the “Settings” by tapping on the gear icon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/back-up-camera-roll-to-snapchat-5.jpg"                      alt="open snapchat settings"                ></p><p>Step2 Scroll down a little to find the option “Memories.” Afterward, you can see the option “Backup Progress.” If you can see the word “Complete,” it means that your Memories are backed up completely.

To activate the Smart Backup feature, read the below instructions:</p><p>Step1 After opening Snapchat, head to its “Settings.” In the Settings menu, locate the option “Memories.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/back-up-camera-roll-to-snapchat-7.jpg"                      alt="choose memories option"                ></p><p>Step2 After tapping on Memories, you can see various options.

Now, turn the lens towards you or someone else as if you are clicking a picture.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong>  Now, click on the smiley face filter button, and tap on the Explore button to continue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/explore-anime-style-filter-snapchat.jpg"                      alt="Explore the snapchat anime filter"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137228/26400" target="_top" id="2137228">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137228" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137228/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Step 4:</strong>  You can now search for Anime Styles. There are several anime filters available, just make sure that the creator of the filter is Snapchat.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong>  Once you have the anime filter, you can record a video of yourself, or take photos. You may also use both back and front cameras to turn anyone into an anime character.</p><p><strong>Pro tip:</strong>  This filter works on already saved photos and videos as well. Try them on too. This filter will work only on your face, though. So, it won’t turn your entire body into an anime character.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Do-I-Get-More-Filters-on-Snapchat"><a href="#Part-3-How-Do-I-Get-More-Filters-on-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How Do I Get More Filters on Snapchat?"></a>Part 3: How Do I Get More Filters on Snapchat?</h2><p>Since Snapchat keeps coming up with attractive filters, you may wonder how you can get more filters to keep using them. Well, there are a few tricks that you can try. We will explain these tricks in detail, so make sure to follow them correctly.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136616/26400" target="_top" id="2136616">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136616" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136616/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Trick-1-Turn-on-Snapchat-Geofilters"><a href="#Trick-1-Turn-on-Snapchat-Geofilters" class="headerlink" title="Trick 1: Turn on Snapchat Geofilters"></a>Trick 1: Turn on Snapchat Geofilters</h3><p>Before you try using Snapchat geofilters, you will first have to permit Snapchat to access your location. Whether you are using iOS or Android, enable location, and you will start seeing geofilters and all the other filters that you have saved.</p><p>Don’t expect a plethora of filters to suddenly turn up. For example, when you apply a geofilter, you will see that it adds an illustration and the place name to your Snap. So, the more you explore and go out, the more filters you will start seeing.</p><h3 id="Trick-2-Check-Online-Resources-on-Lens-Studio-and-Lenslist"><a href="#Trick-2-Check-Online-Resources-on-Lens-Studio-and-Lenslist" class="headerlink" title="Trick 2: Check Online Resources on Lens Studio and Lenslist"></a>Trick 2: Check Online Resources on Lens Studio and Lenslist</h3><p>You can also explore two filter libraries, which are Lens Studio and Lenslist. These are repositories of AR content. These two libraries have many attractive filters. All you need to do is scan the Snapcode available in the filters and unlock them. Both of them will have duplicate filters as well, though. But dig a bit deeper, and you will have enough codes of filters to keep using them every day. You will find these codes in your profile once you add them.</p><h3 id="Trick-3-Share-Snapcodes-for-Snapchat"><a href="#Trick-3-Share-Snapcodes-for-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="Trick 3: Share Snapcodes for Snapchat"></a>Trick 3: Share Snapcodes for Snapchat</h3><p>The last way to add Snapcode of filters is by scanning other people’s codes. Once you go to your profile, you will see your Snapcodes, which other people can scan. Just like that, you can scan other people’s code as well. Some codes will be available for 24 hours, while others for 48 hours. After that, you can scan the code again when you want to reuse them. To scan a code, just hold your camera over the code and allow the screen to register it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118306/7443" target="_top" id="2118306">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118306" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118306/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Bonus-How-to-Add-Anime-Effect-to-Video-with-Filmora"><a href="#Bonus-How-to-Add-Anime-Effect-to-Video-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Bonus: How to Add Anime Effect to Video with Filmora"></a>Bonus: How to Add Anime Effect to Video with Filmora</h2><p>As we shared, Snapchat will only morph your face into an anime character. But if you are not satisfied with that and want to turn a whole video into anime or cartoon, then one of the best ways to go about it is by getting Wondershare Filmora. Filmora is an easy-to-use yet powerful enough video editing tool loaded with stunning effects, such as cartoons, sketches, color sketches, and more. The process is very easy to follow, and to use Filmora, you don’t need to be a pro. Here are the steps that you can follow:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch Wondershare Filmora to your Mac or Windows computer. If you haven’t downloaded it yet, click the Try It Free button below to start.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora  Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora   Mac Version"                > </a></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong>  Now, import media files and load the video that you want to convert into a cartoon or anime to the media library, and then add that video to the timeline.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-video-to-cartoon-anime.jpg"                      alt="add anime filter to video in Filmora"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong>  Go to the Effects option, and type sketch in the search effects bar, which will be on the top of the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-sketch-effect-anime-filter.jpg"                      alt="add anime filter to video in Filmora"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong>  Currently, Filmora provides sketch and color sketch effects. Try each one of them to see which one works the best.

However, Snapchat marketing can be challenging, as the platform constantly evolves and changes.</p><p>This article provides an overview of <strong>Snapchat marketing strategy,</strong> including why businesses should market on this platform, what types of content to post, and how to measure results.</p><p>With the information available in this article, you will be able to create a strategy that works for your business and get succeeded.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/snapchat-app.jpg"                      alt="snapchat app"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Snapchat-Overview"><a href="#Part-1-Snapchat-Overview" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Snapchat Overview"></a>Part 1. Snapchat Overview</h2><p>Firstly, let’s have an overview of Snapchat before we see how to draw your blueprint in Part 3 and Part 4.</p><p>Snapchat - founded by Evan Spiegel, Bobby Murphy, and Reggie Brown - is a unique messaging app because it allows users to send disappearing messages and photos. This feature has made the app popular with young people aged 13-34 who want to communicate without leaving a permanent record.</p><p>As of May 2022, Snapchat has <a class="link"   href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/545967/snapchat-app-dau/#:~:text=How%20many%20daily%20active%20users,increase%20of%20over%2018%20percent." >347 million daily active users. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> That’s impressive growth from its humble beginnings back in 2011. With <a class="link"   href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/272014/global-social-networks-ranked-by-number-of-users/" >monthly active users of 557 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, Snapchat is ranked as the 12th most popular social media platform.</p><p>Not only that, the number of <a class="link"   href="https://www.omnicoreagency.com/snapchat-statistics/" >Snapchat daily video views is 18 billion, <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> making it the best platform to showcase your services&#x2F;products and generate more income. However, all this is only possible with the right <strong>Snapchat marketing strategy.</strong></p><h2 id="Part-2-Why-Should-Business-Market-On-Snapchat"><a href="#Part-2-Why-Should-Business-Market-On-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Why Should Business Market On Snapchat"></a>Part 2. Why Should Business Market On Snapchat</h2><p>So you are probably thinking why your business should be on Snapchat - because it’s popular with teenagers and young adults. In fact, the platform has over 347 million daily active users, with <strong>75%</strong> being under the age of 34.</p><p>Therefore, if you’re targeting a younger demographic, then Snapchat should definitely be part of your social media marketing strategy.</p><p>Another big reason is that Snapchat is incredibly engaging. The average Snapchat user opens the app at least 20 times a day and spends 25 - 30 minutes on the app each day, so that’s a lot of potential exposure for your business.</p><p>Not only that, but since Snapchat is still a new field and opened up <a class="link"   href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/20/snapchat-messaging-app-ad-creepy-ouija" >ads to users in October 2014, <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> many big companies have not entered the market. This has created a huge opportunity for small businesses to market their products and generate leads to increase their sales.</p><p>With Snapchat, you can get discovered by users in their Discovery feeds or via Stories. Also, they can interact with your brand using the Geofilters, stickers, and lenses you’ve produced during your ad campaign.</p><p>For instance, Taco Bell created a filter for Cinco de Mayo. The filter received 224 Million views, which is insane.

Snapchat Overview</h2><p>There is a saying goes: <em>Know the weather, know the terrain, and your victory will be complete.</em> Before we look into the detailed guidance in <a href="#_Methods_To_Make">Part 2</a>, we should know more about Snapchat.</p><p>Snapchat is a photo messaging app developed on September 16, 2011, by Bobby Murphy,Reggie Brown, and Evan Spiegel while they were studying at Stanford University.</p><p>With Snapchat, you can take photos, record videos, add text and drawings, and send them to a controlled list of recipients. These sent MMS are known as “Snaps,” and you can set a time limit on how long recipients can view them (a maximum of 24 hours, after which they will be automatically deleted).</p><p>Since its inception, Snapchat has evolved to include a wider range of features, including live video chat, story sharing, and lenses (augmented reality filters). Each of these functions is discussed below in detail:</p><ul><li><strong>Chat:</strong> A messaging functionality you can use to communicate with your friends and family, share snaps, send stickers, or make a video&#x2F;audio call.</li><li><strong>Stories:</strong> With this feature, you can add a compilation of images or videos for public viewing - available for 24 hours and then automatically disappear.</li><li><strong>Live Stories:</strong> There are stories of other users from a specific location or event that disappear after 24 hours.</li><li><strong>Lenses:</strong> These AR filters can be used to add fun effects to your pictures and post them as your stories or send them to someone.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/snapchat-lens.jpg"                      alt="snapchat lens"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Filters:</strong> Unlike lenses, they are static photo <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >overlays&#x2F;effects <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that you can apply to your pictures to make them more captivating.</li><li><strong>Snap Map:</strong> This functionality lets you share your location with your friends. On the map, you will appear as a Bitmoji for them.</li><li><strong>Snapchat Spotlight:</strong> This is a TikTok-like feature helping many Snapchat users to make money. You can submit your best videos with a chance of earning a share of up to $1 million&#x2F;day, depending on the number of views.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Methods-To-Make-Money-On-Snapchat"><a href="#Part-2-Methods-To-Make-Money-On-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

While most business owners are unaware of Snapchat or how to use it to promote their products and services, you can grab this opportunity to earn more.</p><p>With creative and interactive ads, you can catch users’ attention and advertise other businesses to earn some extra cash in a short time.</p><p>Some ads formats offered by Snapchats are:</p><ul><li>Story ads (a series of ads).</li><li>Collection ads (a series of products).</li><li>Filters (artistic overlays).</li><li>Commercials (up to three minutes long).</li><li>Single image or video ads.</li><li>Lenses (interaction with augmented reality).</li></ul><p>Besides creating ads, you can also help businesses create AR filters and stickers to attract the masses.

As a result, they received a 61% lower cost-per-install than their other campaign.</p><p>Similarly, BACARDÍ produced a lens with the summer theme to enhance their brand awareness and drive more sales.

We will help you get started. Here is our step by step guide on how to make Snapchat lenses.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1"><strong>Part1: Comparing Lens Studio and Creating Your Own Lens</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part2"><strong>Part2: How to Use Lens Studio</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part3"><strong>Part3: How to Create Snapchat Lenses Using Create Your Own Lens</strong></a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-Comparing-Lens-Studio-and-Creating-Your-Own-Lens"><a href="#Part-1-Comparing-Lens-Studio-and-Creating-Your-Own-Lens" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Comparing Lens Studio and Creating Your Own Lens"></a>Part 1: Comparing Lens Studio and Creating Your Own Lens</h2><p>The two programs that we are highlighting today are Lens Studio and Create Your Own Lens. These are both fantastic programs for creating your own Snapchat lens, but they do have slightly different uses. If you are the type of person who wants to design a professional Snapchat lens, you are going to prefer Lens Studio.</p><p>But if you are hoping to come up with something creative that you can share with your friends and family, then you may love Create Your Own Lens. It is a very easy program to use, and it offers a ton of features that you may be surprised to see.</p><h4 id="Snapchat-lenses-is-for-fun"><a href="#Snapchat-lenses-is-for-fun" class="headerlink" title="Snapchat lenses is for fun"></a>Snapchat lenses is for fun</h4><p>The beauty of Snapchat lenses is that you can now create your own environment, which you can use each time you are taking photos or videos. Sure, you can always use the filters that are already available in the application, but not everyone would find those enough.</p><p>If you want some customization, or you just want to mess around until you get the filter that makes sense for you, Snapchat lenses are the way to go.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Lens-Studio.JPG"                      alt="lens studio"                ></p><h4 id="Lens-Studio-is-for-business"><a href="#Lens-Studio-is-for-business" class="headerlink" title="Lens Studio is for business"></a>Lens Studio is for business</h4><p>Lens Studio is perfect for businesses that may want to create unique environments for their clients, or the times when they are releasing company Snapchat posts. Say the company is hosting an event. They may want a custom graphic for that event, which is used for all the pictures and videos posted to Snapchat about the event. Using Lens Studio lets them do that with ease.</p><p>Create Your Own Lens is great when you are going to a special event, birthday party or graduating, and you want a special graphic that comes up in all your snaps. It is very intuitive to use, and is available through the App Store as a download.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/len-studio-snapchat.JPG"                      alt="lens studio snapchat"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1938698/19272" target="_top" id="1938698">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1938698" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1938698/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Use-Lens-Studio"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Use-Lens-Studio" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Use Lens Studio"></a>Part 2: How to Use Lens Studio</h2><h4 id="1-Download-Lens-Studio"><a href="#1-Download-Lens-Studio" class="headerlink" title="1. Download Lens Studio"></a>1. Download Lens Studio</h4><p>The first step involves downloading Lens Studio, which you can do from your computer. It is compatible with both Windows and Mac computers, and will run on any semi-modern system. According to the Snapchat team, Lens Studio is similar to the program used by their AR teams to create lenses. That means you are getting similar functionality, but with an easier to manage interface.</p><h4 id="2-Choose-Templates-Page"><a href="#2-Choose-Templates-Page" class="headerlink" title="2. Choose Templates Page"></a>2. Choose Templates Page</h4><p>It is normal to feel a little overwhelmed the first time you try and use this program. But that is why the templates page is so great. You can select from templates depending on the type of lens that you are hoping to create. You can just use a template, or you can incorporate your own ideas to customize the template.</p><p>There is also a Lens Studio Overview guide that you can access online, which will help you get acquainted with the program’s various features and quirks.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lens-studio-templates.JPG"                      alt="lens studio templates"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144309/7443" target="_top" id="2144309">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144309" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144309/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h4 id="3-Use-Studio-Panels"><a href="#3-Use-Studio-Panels" class="headerlink" title="3.

This is the area where you can add your own 2D or 3D objects, and you can visualize how they would look as a Snapchat filter. You can add, remove, resize and drag objects to specific areas of the screen.</p><p>There are other tools accessible from the Resources panel.

When you are satisfied with the image on the preview, you can pair your phone with the application, and you will be able to send that Snapchat lens onto your phone through your Snapcode. It is that simple!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/preview-snapchat.JPG"                      alt="preview lens studio"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Create-Snapchat-Lenses-Using-Create-Your-Own-Lens"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Create-Snapchat-Lenses-Using-Create-Your-Own-Lens" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Create Snapchat Lenses Using Create Your Own Lens"></a>Part 3: How to Create Snapchat Lenses Using Create Your Own Lens</h2><ol><li>There are two ways that you can access the tool for creating fun Snapchat lenses. You can either visit the website snapchat.com&#x2F;create, or you can go on the “filters and lenses” section on your iOS device. If you are using Snapchat on an Android device, you will only have the option for the website. But the feature is coming to the Android version of Snapchat very soon.</li><li>When you are in the application or on the website, you may start to look at the different templates for Snapchat lenses. Now you can add other items into the templates, such as photographs, text or graphics.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-snapchat.JPG"                      alt="create snapchat"                ></p><p>It is all up to your imagination. You can create the perfect Snapchat lens, which you can then send into your Snapchat account through your Snapcode. Of course, if you are using your iOS device to create the lens, it is already linked to your account.</p><p>Another cool feature is how you can set the location for where the Snapchat lens is available. Say you are hosting a party. You can have the Snapchat lens available to everyone who uses Snapchat within a set square footage of your home. That is an amazing way to let everyone share social media pictures and photos of your party, through the lens you created.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Creating Snapchat lenses has never been easier. Whether you are a business looking to add a custom lens, or you just want to create a fun lens for a graduation or party, there are tools that make the job very easy. Using these tools will allow you to create the perfect Snapchat lens for any occasion.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2100530/7443" target="_top" id="2100530">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2100530" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2100530/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Ollie Mattison</p><p>Ollie Mattison is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Ollie Mattison</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-elevate-the-art-of-storytelling-6-leading-snapchat-apps/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Elevate the Art of Storytelling 6 Leading Snapchat Apps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/024-approved-steps-to-bypass-youtube-prohibitions/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Steps to Bypass YouTube Prohibitions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-unveiling-the-secrets-to-snap-success/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Unveiling the Secrets to Snap Success</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/new-fundamentals-of-designing-high-converting-snap-ads/"><u>[New] Fundamentals of Designing High-Converting Snap Ads</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-secrets-to-flawless-ppt-video-transcriptions/"><u>[New] In 2024, Secrets to Flawless PPT Video Transcriptions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/new-master-the-art-of-picture-perfection-on-snapchat-apps-for-2024/"><u>[New] Master the Art of Picture Perfection on Snapchat Apps for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-unintended-tiktok-rewind-what-now/"><u>[New] Unintended TikTok Rewind – What Now?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-6-best-snapchat-video-editors-on-android-and-iphone/"><u>[Updated] 6 Best Snapchat Video Editors on Android and iPhone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-discover-the-best-15-youtube-science-think-tanks/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Discover the Best 15 YouTube Science Think Tanks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-long-term-snappiness-keeping-streaks-uninterrupted/"><u>[Updated] Long-Term Snappiness Keeping Streaks Uninterrupted</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/approved-decoding-the-best-of-beauty-youtubes-elite-artists-showcased/"><u>2024 Approved Decoding the Best of Beauty YouTube's Elite Artists Showcased</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-giggle-genesis-creepy-clones-with-a-smile/"><u>2024 Approved Giggle Genesis Creepy Clones with a Smile</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-how-to-keep-up-the-snapstreak-game/"><u>2024 Approved How To Keep Up the Snapstreak Game</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/2024-approved-peak-performances-in-oly-x-cross-2022/"><u>2024 Approved Peak Performances in Oly X-Cross 2022</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-useful.techidaily.com/guide-simple-pour-creer-un-systeme-de-partage-et-de-mise-en-synchro-des-dossiers-sur-windows-1187-across-multiples-lecteurs/"><u>Guide Simple Pour Créer Un Système De Partage Et De Mise en Synchro Des Dossiers Sur Windows 11/8/7 Across Multiples Lecteurs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-capture-memories-in-teams-snap-camera-guide/"><u>In 2024, Capture Memories in Teams Snap Camera Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11-tips.techidaily.com/reconciling-with-a-non-responsive-printer-in-os/"><u>Reconciling With a Non-Responsive Printer in OS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/the-clever-way-to-compress-streamlined-windows-explorer/"><u>The Clever Way to Compress: Streamlined Windows Explorer</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-checklist-for-transferring-snaps-to-photos-folder-for-2024/"><u>The Ultimate Checklist for Transferring Snaps to Photos Folder for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Ideas To Create And Send Snaps Quickly"></a>Tip 1. Ideas To Create And Send Snaps Quickly</h3><p>Below are some tips&#x2F;ideas to help you quickly create and send Snaps to keep your Snapchat streak alive:</p><p><strong>Idea 1. Edit Blank Snap And Send As New Snap</strong></p><p>If you have run out of snap ideas, don’t worry about sending a high-quality one. No one is judging you, so send a blank snap to keep the streak alive; however, edit it a little so it looks like you have put in some effort.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/sending-a-blank-screen-to-keep-streak-alive.jpg"                      alt="sending a blank screen to keep streak alive"                ></p><p><strong>Idea 2. Send Black Screen</strong></p><p>Your Snapstreaks are about to expire, and you’re freaking out? Here’s a little hack that will keep them alive: send a black screen snap. That’s right! You can also add some doodles or stickers to the picture to make things look more interesting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/sending-blank-screen-as-snap.jpg"                      alt="sending blank screen as snap"                ></p><p><strong>Idea 3. Use Emojis And Bitmojis</strong></p><p>You can also add emojis or Bitmojis to your photos to make them look more interesting and fun. Simply open up the Snapchat app, click a picture, and tap on the emoji icon to select the emoji or Bitmoji that you want to add to your Snap. You can even resize and move them around to get it just right.</p><p><strong>Idea 4. Snap With Your Pets</strong></p><p>We all love our pets - and we also like staying connected with our friends on Snapchat. So why not combine the two? Occasionally take a picture of your pet using the app and send it to your besties to make their day and keep the streak alive!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/snap-with-pet-to-maintain-streak.jpg"                      alt="snap with pet to maintain streak"                ></p><p><strong>Idea 5. Streak With Daily Food</strong></p><p>Food is always a good topic and can be one of the best ways to keep your Snapchat streak alive. Simply send a snap to your friend every day before you start munching.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/streak-daily-food.jpg"                      alt="streak daily food"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-2-Seize-Occasions-And-Keep-Your-Snapchat-Sneak-Alive"><a href="#Tip-2-Seize-Occasions-And-Keep-Your-Snapchat-Sneak-Alive" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2.

Seize Occasions And Keep Your Snapchat Sneak Alive</h3><p>To keep your Snapchat streak alive, try to seize any opportunity you can to take pictures and send them to friends. Below are some ideas to do this:</p><p><strong>Idea 1. The First Day Matters</strong></p><p>Many people choose to start their streaks on special days because it helps them remember to keep them alive.

Memorable Day</strong></p><p>We all have memorable days in our lives, like a milestone, graduation, or special event that we want to remember forever. What is a better way to commemorate them than with a Snap? Your friends and family will appreciate it, and you will be able to keep your streak alive for days to come.</p><p><strong>Idea 3. Streak While Traveling</strong></p><p>Whenever you are on a trip, travel to your office&#x2F;college, or head out to run some errands, remember to take a picture of the surroundings that look interesting and send it to whom you are establishing the streak.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/send-snapstreak-while-traveling.jpg"                      alt="send snapstreak while traveling"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-3-Organize-Your-Snapchat-And-Your-Time"><a href="#Tip-3-Organize-Your-Snapchat-And-Your-Time" class="headerlink" title="Tip 3. Organize Your Snapchat And Your Time"></a>Tip 3. Organize Your Snapchat And Your Time</h3><p>Are you trying to get the most out of Snapchat without letting it take over your life? Below we’ve provided some ideas to help you organize your time and your snaps.</p><p><strong>Idea 1. Edit the Name of your Snapchat Friends</strong></p><p>To avoid losing your Snapchat streaks with any of your contacts, you should start editing their names. Snapchat lists your most contacted friends at the top, so you might not see the others who are lower on your list. Editing their names to include something that will help you search for them will make it easier to avoid forgetting to send them a snap regularly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/edit-the-name-of-your-snapchat-friend.jpg"                      alt="edit the name of your snapchat friend"                ></p><p><strong>Idea 2. Pin Your Conversations</strong></p><p>If you want to keep someone at the top of your chat list, consider pinning their chat. This will also ultimately help you send snaps to them without breaking the streak.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/pin-conversation-in-snapchat.jpg"                      alt="pin conversation in snapchat"                ></p><p><strong>Idea 3. Stick to a Particular Time of the Day</strong></p><p>You will gain more by starting your Snapstreaks later on in the day, especially if you are only sending one snap per day. This way, the hourglass emoji will be visible for a considerable amount of time before it expires.</p><p><strong>Idea 4. Check Your Filters</strong></p><p>If you’re trying to keep up with multiple Snapstreaks at once, it’s easy to forget who you’re on a streak with. But there’s a way to see them without going to your list of friends.</p><p>Whenever you’re about to send a new snap, swipe through the filters. Here, you’ll see a special Snapchat streak filter, which will show how many consecutive days of successful streak you have in big white numbers next to the fire emoji.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>In this article, we’ve compiled a list of fun and creative <strong>Snapchat streak ideas</strong> to help you stay connected with your friends.</p><p>Hopefully, by following these tips, you can now keep your Snapchat streak alive and stay connected with your contacts in a better and more engaging way!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><h2 id="Snappy-Stories-How-to-Record-Snapchat-Mobilely"><a href="#Snappy-Stories-How-to-Record-Snapchat-Mobilely" class="headerlink" title="Snappy Stories - How to Record Snapchat Mobilely"></a>Snappy Stories - How to Record Snapchat Mobilely</h2><p>Snapchat has 306 million users daily worldwide.

The limitation is that the receiver of the snap would be able to see that the sent picture is from the camera roll.</p><p>Step1 Open your Snapchat and swipe up to open the ‘Memories’. Go to your Camera Roll and select any particular picture from there.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/send-snaps-from-camera-roll-1.jpg"                      alt="access camera roll tab"                ></p><p>Step2 After choosing a particular photo, tap on the “<strong>Edit</strong>“ icon at the bottom left corner.

Hence, it is not possible to save other’s pictures or videos in Snapchat in incognito mode. You don’t need apps to save Snapchat to your phone. There is hardly a feasible way to do so without the senders’ knowledge. In such a situation, you can try out the following option – saving Snaps in flight mode.</p><p> Here are the steps</p><ol><li>First of all, launch the Snapchat app on your mobile phone and leave it open. Go to your phone’s ‘Settings’ (Android&#x2F;iPhone) and toggle on the ‘Airplane&#x2F;Flight’ mode. Airplane&#x2F;Flight mode disables all the wireless connections, be it network signals or internet related services for your device (Wi-Fi as well as cellular).</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snapchat-save-without-knowing.JPG"                      alt="snapchat save without knowing"                ></p><ol start="2"><li>Browse the Snapchat inbox and view the desired Snap that you wish to save, and quickly take a screenshot. Make sure to be quick enough and do it before the Snap expires.</li><li>Now, logout from your Snapchat account right after taking the screenshot. You need to follow the logout process according to your device specific settings. Being in ‘Airplane&#x2F;Flight’ mode you can’t logout, but click the logout option anyway (this is vital!).</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snapchat-log-out.JPG"                      alt="snapchat log out"                ></p><ol start="4"><li>Here, you need to close the Snapchat app on your mobile phone by swiping out the Snapchat app (up&#x2F;sideways depending on Android&#x2F;iPhone) from your device’s force quit screen.</li><li>Toggle off the ‘Airplane&#x2F;Flight’ mode and wait until your phone connects to the Wi-Fi or mobile network. Now, launch the Snapchat app again and login with the same credentials. The Snaps you have taken screenshots of will still appear as unopened on the storyboard and your friend will have no clue about the Snap being screenshot.</li></ol><p> <strong>Read More to Get :</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Screenshot on Snapchat without Them Knowing &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-save-Snapchat-videos-on-Mac"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-save-Snapchat-videos-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to save Snapchat videos on Mac"></a>Part 2: How to save Snapchat videos on Mac</h2><p> After learning to take screenshots of Snaps using the ‘Airplane’ mode, how about saving Snapchat videos on your Mac computer? Yes, you can easily save Snapchat videos using your iPhone and Mac computer. The process involves recording your iPhone’s screen through your Mac as a movie and then saving it. Here is how to do it</p><ol><li>Take and connect your iPhone and Mac computer using a lightning cable. Make sure that they are pre-synced. Now, launch QuickTime Player on your computer and then tap ‘File’ in the finder menu, then ‘New Movie Recording’.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snapchat-quiktime.JPG"                      alt="snapchat quicktime"                ></p><ol start="2"><li>This will make your Mac’s camera act as the primary camera&#x2F;recording device.

The iPhone will be available under both the Camera and Microphone section, choose it for both the options.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snapchat-record.JPG"                      alt="snapchat record"                ></p><ol start="3"><li>You’ll now notice that your iPhone’s screen has been mirrored with your Mac computer.</li><li>Now, on your iPhone, go to Snapchat and browse the inbox. Subsequently, on your Mac, tap the ‘Record’ button and then start viewing the snaps on your iPhone. QuickTime will record everything from the snaps and save it on your computer.</li><li>After you’re done with recording, tap the ‘Record’ button again to stop it. Lastly, go to ‘File’ and click ‘Save’, the file format to which the file will be saved is .mov which is generally supported by majority of movie players.</li></ol><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-save-Snapchat-videos-on-Android"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-save-Snapchat-videos-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to save Snapchat videos on Android"></a>Part 3: How to save Snapchat videos on Android</h2><p> In case you are looking for a way to save Snapchat videos, take screenshots of chats, make slideshows of stories, or record other’s stories on your Android device itself, then AZ Screen recorder is one such app to save those Snapchats.
