The best part about anime filter is that it has the ability to transform your videos and images into anime instantly. This filter has already gone viral on other social media platforms, such as TikTok, Instagram, and Twitter.</p><p>Filters and effects are not new when it comes to social media services, and almost all of them have their own versions, which you can use. Snapchat is here with a new lens, which is becoming immensely popular. If you have been trying to use the <strong>Snapchat anime</strong> filter and don’t know how to go about it, you have come to the right place because this article will talk about how to get this filter and how to use it.

It’s a filter that will morph a person’s photo or video into an anime character and will customize the anime face based on the person’s facial features. So, rather than simply applying a generic image on top of your face, Snapchat makes sure that the anime image looks similar to your actual image. And as a result, each person’s anime face turns out to be different.</p><p>Since the hashtag #animefilter is trending, you can also apply the anime filter on your face and be a part of the trend. The reaction to this filter is lowkey amazing because the filter not only changes your face and makes it look like a part of a hit anime cartoon series or movie, but it sometimes also changes your hair color making you look like the King of the Pirates or Rapunzel. What this lens will do and how your image will turn out to be is highly fascinating.</p><p>What stands out is that after the <strong>anime</strong> <strong>filter</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>Snapchat</strong> was released, it has been used over 3 billion times. Snapchat has confirmed this statistic in its Third Quarter 2020 Financial report, and they even said that they already knew it would be a massive hit.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144287/7443" target="_top" id="2144287">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144287" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144287/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Get-the-Anime-Filter-on-Snapchat"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Get-the-Anime-Filter-on-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Get the Anime Filter on Snapchat?"></a>Part 2: How to Get the Anime Filter on Snapchat?</h2><p>Now that you know how popular the <strong>Snapchat anime filter</strong> is. It’s worth knowing how to get it. Although this filter is available on Snapchat, many users are facing issues finding it. This section will show you two easy ways to get this filter. You can use one or both methods and start using the filter to show the world how you will look like an anime character. Here are the two ways:</p><h3 id="Method-1-Get-the-Anime-Face-Filter-on-Snapchat-via-Link"><a href="#Method-1-Get-the-Anime-Face-Filter-on-Snapchat-via-Link" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Get the Anime Face Filter on Snapchat via Link"></a>Method 1: Get the Anime Face Filter on Snapchat via Link</h3><p><strong>Step 1:</strong>  First, click on the link <a class="link"   href="https://www.snapchat.com/unlock/?type=SNAPCODE&uuid=ff9460034fee44a08e9a4282560cce36&metadata=01" >here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. You will need this link to get the anime face filter.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong>  Once you click on the click, a pop-up window will open. If you haven’t downloaded the anime filter yet, then Snapchat will say, “New lens found.” Right below it, you will see the message “unlock for 48 hours.” Go ahead and click on that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/unlock-anime-filter-for-48-hours.jpg"                      alt="Unlock the snapchat anime filter"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong>  By clicking on the purple button, your <strong>Snapchat anime</strong> filter will be available for use for 48 hours.</p><p>Here’s a pro tip, if you want to continue using this filter, once the 48 hours are over, simply repeat the steps, and you can use it for additional 48 hours. Simple!</p><p>If the pop-up says, “nothing to see here”, which means you have the filter already. In this case, you can go to Snapchat and click the filter accordingly.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105870/7443" target="_top" id="2105870">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105870" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105870/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Method-2-Get-the-Anime-Style-Filter-via-Explore-on-Snapchat"><a href="#Method-2-Get-the-Anime-Style-Filter-via-Explore-on-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Get the Anime Style Filter via Explore on Snapchat"></a>Method 2: Get the Anime Style Filter via Explore on Snapchat</h3><p>If you don’t want to click any unknown links, you can explore the anime filter by searching on Snapchat.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong>  Make sure your Snapchat is up-to-date. If not, update it to the latest version.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong>  Open Snapchat on your mobile or tablet, whichever you are using. Now, turn the lens towards you or someone else as if you are clicking a picture.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong>  Now, click on the smiley face filter button, and tap on the Explore button to continue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/explore-anime-style-filter-snapchat.jpg"                      alt="Explore the snapchat anime filter"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong>  You can now search for Anime Styles. There are several anime filters available, just make sure that the creator of the filter is Snapchat.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong>  Once you have the anime filter, you can record a video of yourself, or take photos. You may also use both back and front cameras to turn anyone into an anime character.</p><p><strong>Pro tip:</strong>  This filter works on already saved photos and videos as well. Try them on too. This filter will work only on your face, though. So, it won’t turn your entire body into an anime character.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Do-I-Get-More-Filters-on-Snapchat"><a href="#Part-3-How-Do-I-Get-More-Filters-on-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How Do I Get More Filters on Snapchat?"></a>Part 3: How Do I Get More Filters on Snapchat?</h2><p>Since Snapchat keeps coming up with attractive filters, you may wonder how you can get more filters to keep using them. Well, there are a few tricks that you can try. We will explain these tricks in detail, so make sure to follow them correctly.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://wigfever.sjv.io/c/5597632/2014859/22899" target="_top" id="2014859">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22899-2014859" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://wigfever.sjv.io/i/5597632/2014859/22899"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Trick-1-Turn-on-Snapchat-Geofilters"><a href="#Trick-1-Turn-on-Snapchat-Geofilters" class="headerlink" title="Trick 1: Turn on Snapchat Geofilters"></a>Trick 1: Turn on Snapchat Geofilters</h3><p>Before you try using Snapchat geofilters, you will first have to permit Snapchat to access your location. Whether you are using iOS or Android, enable location, and you will start seeing geofilters and all the other filters that you have saved.</p><p>Don’t expect a plethora of filters to suddenly turn up. For example, when you apply a geofilter, you will see that it adds an illustration and the place name to your Snap. So, the more you explore and go out, the more filters you will start seeing.</p><h3 id="Trick-2-Check-Online-Resources-on-Lens-Studio-and-Lenslist"><a href="#Trick-2-Check-Online-Resources-on-Lens-Studio-and-Lenslist" class="headerlink" title="Trick 2: Check Online Resources on Lens Studio and Lenslist"></a>Trick 2: Check Online Resources on Lens Studio and Lenslist</h3><p>You can also explore two filter libraries, which are Lens Studio and Lenslist. These are repositories of AR content. These two libraries have many attractive filters. All you need to do is scan the Snapcode available in the filters and unlock them. Both of them will have duplicate filters as well, though. But dig a bit deeper, and you will have enough codes of filters to keep using them every day. You will find these codes in your profile once you add them.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068407/7443" target="_top" id="2068407">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068407" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068407/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Trick-3-Share-Snapcodes-for-Snapchat"><a href="#Trick-3-Share-Snapcodes-for-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="Trick 3: Share Snapcodes for Snapchat"></a>Trick 3: Share Snapcodes for Snapchat</h3><p>The last way to add Snapcode of filters is by scanning other people’s codes. Once you go to your profile, you will see your Snapcodes, which other people can scan. Just like that, you can scan other people’s code as well. Some codes will be available for 24 hours, while others for 48 hours. After that, you can scan the code again when you want to reuse them. To scan a code, just hold your camera over the code and allow the screen to register it.</p><h2 id="Bonus-How-to-Add-Anime-Effect-to-Video-with-Filmora"><a href="#Bonus-How-to-Add-Anime-Effect-to-Video-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Bonus: How to Add Anime Effect to Video with Filmora"></a>Bonus: How to Add Anime Effect to Video with Filmora</h2><p>As we shared, Snapchat will only morph your face into an anime character. But if you are not satisfied with that and want to turn a whole video into anime or cartoon, then one of the best ways to go about it is by getting Wondershare Filmora. Filmora is an easy-to-use yet powerful enough video editing tool loaded with stunning effects, such as cartoons, sketches, color sketches, and more. The process is very easy to follow, and to use Filmora, you don’t need to be a pro. Here are the steps that you can follow:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch Wondershare Filmora to your Mac or Windows computer.

Try each one of them to see which one works the best. If you want to add the filter to the entire video, just drag and drop the filter to the video, and it’s done.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-sketch-effect-video.jpg"                      alt="add sketch filter to video in Filmora"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong>  Finally, click on the Export button after everything is done to save the edited video on your computer.</p><p>Note: If you want to add the sketch effect to the person only, you can use the Human Segmentation in AI Portrait. In this way, you can also try the Cartoon effect to see the result.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"

Its lenses and filters are quite popular and dominating in the selfie game all around us. These filters can be a lot of fun, from changing your hairstyle to changing your background.</p><p>Snapchat offers its users almost every type of filter you can imagine. Nearly half a million filters are created every single month, which are perfectly working. From kids to grown-ups, everyone uses these filters for fun, to make themselves look weird, cool, or just a bit nicer. Snapchat has plenty of lenses and cool filters, making people fall in love with the app. People can also create their filters and help them engage with their brands and businesses. Let’s explore some of the best Snapchat filters of 2021!</p><h2 id="Part-1-Most-Popular-Snapchat-Filters-for-Selfies-in-2021"><a href="#Part-1-Most-Popular-Snapchat-Filters-for-Selfies-in-2021" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Most Popular Snapchat Filters for Selfies in 2021"></a>Part 1: Most Popular Snapchat Filters for Selfies in 2021</h2><p><strong>Let’s have a look at the most popular Snapchat filters for selfies as we all know there’s a big range to choose from!</strong></p><h4 id="1-Fire-Sunglasses"><a href="#1-Fire-Sunglasses" class="headerlink" title="1.  Fire Sunglasses"></a>1.  Fire Sunglasses</h4><p>Whenever the users are feeling energetic and motivated, they use the “fire sunglasses” filter. They want to show everyone that they’re on fire, and there couldn’t be a better filter than this. It provides the users with a pair of glasses with fire on the glass, which adds to the energy.</p><p>The fire on the contacts gives you a fiery and relaxed look that catches people’s attention. People can use it after their workouts or for motivational posts. This filter puts up an uplifting mood and gives you good vibes, but it might not be best suited for everyone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snapchat-fire-glasses-filter-lens.jpg"                      alt="Most popular Snapchat filters - Fire Sunglasses "                ></p><h4 id="2-Neon-Horns"><a href="#2-Neon-Horns" class="headerlink" title="2.  Neon Horns"></a>2.  Neon Horns</h4><p>The Classic filter, the devil’s horn but in neon! Incredibly catchy to the eye and gives you a devilish look. This filter is a classic and is here to stay for a long time; there’s no doubt in that.</p><p>For the first time, Horn Filters have taken one step further and given it a neon effect, making it even more appealing. The user can change the horn color; various options have been offered, such as black and white. Some more color options include lime green, magenta, orange, and light blue. It is an evergreen filter but has limited use. Want to know the best part? It sits perfectly according to your filter and does not glitch at all.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/neon-horns-snapchat-filters.jpg"                      alt="Most popular Snapchat filters - Neon Horns "                ></p><h4 id="3-Cartoon-3D-Style"><a href="#3-Cartoon-3D-Style" class="headerlink" title="3.  Cartoon 3D Style"></a>3.  Cartoon 3D Style</h4><p>Cartoon 3D Style, one of the most popular filters on Snapchat and has every right to be! It gives you that unique specific animated look making you look like you just stepped out of a Disney movie. This filter adjusts itself according to our face cut and turns into Disney cartoons such as Kristoff.</p><p>People love to fool around with funny filters, and this one here has to be the best of them all. It gets better: from children to adults, everyone has undoubtedly used this filter. This filter has a soft shading giving it that artistic look like it had been hand-drawn; it’s pretty fun when you make different faces with the filter on your face. This makes it the best filter on Snapchat!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snapchat-cartoon-3d-filter-lens.jpg"                      alt="Most popular Snapchat filters - Cartoon 3D Style "                ></p><h4 id="4-Scary-Mask"><a href="#4-Scary-Mask" class="headerlink" title="4.  Scary Mask"></a>4.  Scary Mask</h4><p>When people get bored from typical filters and don’t get much response, they use funny or scary filters, which are way more fun. But here’s the kicker: this filter covers half your face with a golden skull mask and turns your eyes into a golden flame color too. If we look at this from a different perspective, this can also spread awareness to wear masks during these challenging times. This filter has received so much response from the Snapchat users and finds a place in the “best filters on Snapchat” list!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snapchat-scary-mask-filter.jpg"                      alt="Most popular Snapchat filters - Scary Mask "                ></p><h4 id="5-Lips-Freckles"><a href="#5-Lips-Freckles" class="headerlink" title="5.  Lips Freckles"></a>5.  Lips Freckles</h4><p>This is the perfect filter for you whenever you’re in the mood to give or take some love. It applies lips freckles near your eye and cheek area, making them look like there are freckles. You can even send these pictures to your loved ones and see how happy they get. Stuff like this is best when shared, especially with your loved ones, and experience some mutual good vibes.</p><p>Even when you feel lonely, it will bring you closer to the people far away from you, and you can even keep these memories safe with both of you. Isn’t that great? This filter proves to be one of the best Snapchat filters for selfies.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lips-freckles-filter-snapchat.jpg"                      alt="Most popular Snapchat filters - Lips Freckles "                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Best-Snapchat-Filters-and-Lens-You-Should-Try-In-2021"><a href="#Part-2-Best-Snapchat-Filters-and-Lens-You-Should-Try-In-2021" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Best Snapchat Filters and Lens You Should Try In 2021"></a>Part 2: Best Snapchat Filters and Lens You Should Try In 2021</h2><p>Snapchat filters are not just from developers, but there are some default filters on Snapchat too.

While Facebook and Instagram have long been in the scene, new ones like TikTok and Snapchat are starting to pop up. If you are operating your business in the 21st century and still have not developed your presence in them, then, believe it or not, you are truly missing out on a whole lot of opportunities. But the million-dollar question is – what’s the difference between the two marketing channels from the perspective of an influencer and a marketer? The article here draws out the dissimilarities between the two for the brands to identify the most fitting potential marketing channel to promote themselves.</p><h2 id="Basic-Comparison-Between-TikTok-and-Snapchat"><a href="#Basic-Comparison-Between-TikTok-and-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="Basic Comparison Between TikTok and Snapchat"></a>Basic Comparison Between TikTok and Snapchat</h2><p>Before digging into the dissimilarities between the two apps, don’t you think it’s better to draw insight into them individually? The section here introduces both TikTok and Snapchat individually, highlighting interesting facts that might help you draw out the basic differences between the two social media networks.</p><p><strong>TikTok Fundamentals</strong></p><p>A very popular video-sharing app, launched by the Chinese multinational internet technology company ByteDance in 2017. By the end of 2018, it took the world by storm, especially in the USA. At the end of 2019, it generated 1.5 billion downloads from all around the world.</p><p>Regarding its purpose, it was tailored to entertain users with short, looping, mostly humorous videos. If you are looking for a platform to showcase your talent with choreographed dance numbers, reaction videos, lip-syncing, and a potent participant of hashtag challenge, TikTok is the ideal platform to open up.</p><p>Popular mostly among the Gen-Z audience, 49% of whom hail from the age cohort 13-16, it once again proves its competitiveness in the list of social media networks. As per advertising is concerned, it’s mostly in the form of branded filters, takeovers, top view ads, hashtag challenges, in-feed native video ads, and influencer brand partnerships.</p><p><strong>Snapchat Fundamentals</strong></p><p>A mobile messaging app ideal for sharing both visual, and textual content, including videos, photos and texts. Unlike TikTok, it’s relatively old and was launched back in the year 2011.</p><p>Contrary to TikTok, Snapchat does not just allow users to keep pace with the current trend but also connect with buddies over Stories and other ephemeral content. It’s empowering both users and brands with abilities to showcase creativity through 3D environment interactions, object scanning, and try-on effects.</p><p>Regarding its target audience, they are mostly the millennials, 218 million of whom fall into the list of active users. From a marketing perspective, it permits brands to promote themselves through shoppable ads, branded filters, personalized targeting, AR lenses, and Snap Ad.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Basic Difference</strong></th><th><strong>TikTok</strong></th><th><strong>Snapchat</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>App Type</strong></td><td>Video-sharing app</td><td>Mobile messaging app</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Usage</strong></td><td>For the sake of Entertainment</td><td>Connecting with friends and updating oneself to the latest trends</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Audience</strong></td><td>Gen-Z</td><td>Millennials</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Advertising</strong></td><td>CPM (Cost Per Thousand Impressions) basis</td><td>Snap Ad, Shoppable ads, Personalized Targeting &amp; Native Checkout</td></tr></tbody></table><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135372/19272" target="_top" id="2135372">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135372" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="336" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135372/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="TikTok-vs-Snapchat-What-Influencers-Need-to-Know"><a href="#TikTok-vs-Snapchat-What-Influencers-Need-to-Know" class="headerlink" title="TikTok vs. Snapchat: What Influencers Need to Know"></a>TikTok vs. Snapchat: What Influencers Need to Know</h2><p>Wondering what’s an Influencer? Well, it’s someone you hire to promote your organization’s products when you fail to reach out to a wider audience. The person entrusted with the responsibilities of marketing your brand will ensure the flooding in of more followers for greater exposure. It’s a concept similar to social media influencers that you would find in both TikTok and Snapchat.</p><p>From the stance of an Influencer, here are 5 differences between the two apps.</p><ul><li><strong>Core Features</strong></li></ul><p>Influencers tend to look for features for creating a gripping visual content. TikTok ushers a quite a few of them, including video capture, filter effects, sound library, impressive editing tools, creation prompts and a ‘For You’ page, where the discovery feed based on algorithm is available.</p><p>On the contrary, Snapchat features similar such tools but with the only difference being in the count. You will find here more options besides video capture and editing tools, these being text and video chat, AR Lenses, Story creation, Discover tab, image capture, and Snap Maps.</p><ul><li><strong>Type of Users</strong></li></ul><p>While in TikTok, you will mostly find the celebrities, renowned brands and content creators to flood the social media platform; in Snapchat, the crowd mostly comprises of publishers.</p><ul><li><strong>Demographic</strong></li></ul><p>Mostly Gen-Z occupies the crowd in TikTok, majority of whom belong to the age group 18-24. However, Snapchat is mostly dominated by millennials.</p><ul><li><strong>Active Users</strong></li></ul><p>The relatively new app of TikTok happens to attract fewer active users, accounting 41 million globally, whereas Snapchat enjoys the presence of 218 million population daily.</p><ul><li><strong>Downloads</strong></li></ul><p>Probably because TikTok is new to people that 738 million of them have downloaded the app from all around the world in the year 2019 itself. However, Snapchat recorded 75 million globally in the same year.</p><p>An influencer observes all the above statistics before choosing to go for the preferred social media network.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://electronicx.pxf.io/c/5597632/1167086/14483" target="_top" id="1167086">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14483-1167086" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://electronicx.pxf.io/i/5597632/1167086/14483"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="TikTok-vs-Snapchat-What-Marketers-Should-Know"><a href="#TikTok-vs-Snapchat-What-Marketers-Should-Know" class="headerlink" title="TikTok vs. Snapchat: What Marketers Should Know"></a>TikTok vs. Snapchat: What Marketers Should Know</h2><p>Sometimes, marketers seem to put all their energy into an app without realizing the level of effectiveness it would generate. The same holds for TikTok and Snapchat. So, it’s always wise to walk through the pros and cons of both, seek out the contrasting points from the perspective of certain key indicators and then decide. If you are here wondering where to start your advertising campaign from, go through the points below to make an informed decision.</p><ul><li><strong>Content Marketing</strong></li></ul><p>Go for the TikTok app, if you are targeting the Gen-Z population and currently undergoing budget constraints. With inclusions of hashtags and keywords, you can optimize the video content, attract your target audience, and build a community around you. However, it’s not a very promising app for directing traffic to your website as the social media network allows only a few brands to share the link of their created videos in the website content.</p><p>On the contrary, Snapchat is the most favorable app among brands seeking a platform to launch short, bite-sized videos to promote a newly-launched product and gain admiration from both Gen-Z and millennials. And the best thing? You can always draw online traffic to your website through them and generate greater conversions.</p><ul><li><strong>Marketing Opportunities</strong></li></ul><p>Lucrative opportunities await the small businesses investing their time and energy in TikTok because the platform being relatively new, sets limited norms on what makes content engaging and what fails to achieve it. Moreover, it’s a great spot to test the waters before going widespread with your products over other social media networks.</p><p>Snapchat, on the contrary, is most suitable for mid-sized and large-scale companies because it lacks the perspective of free content creation. However, plenty of advertising alternatives are floating up for brands to leverage, which is why most of the companies are now investing more in it than other advertising channels. Moreover, it enables all business users to share links of created content on websites that TikTok fails to cover.</p><p>Put simply, Snapchat promises more marketing opportunities to businesses that have ample funds whereas TikTok favors those who are pressed for money. But, speaking of brand-friendliness, the latter welcomes more experiments than prior.</p><ul><li><strong>User Base &amp; Behavior</strong></li></ul><p>Prior to launching a promotional campaign, don’t you think it’s prudent to grab an idea about the user base in each app? Of course, otherwise, you will be landing with the wrong audience and gradually fail to generate enough conversions.</p><p>Believe it or not, but reports claim that Snapchat is home to 210 million active users daily, whereas TikTok to 800 million every month. Though both the apps attract millennials and Gen-Z users, launching your ad campaign in the prior will mean more exposure of your products to a vast audience, 61% of whom are female. However, if you are focusing more on men, TikTok will a great platform to start with because 56% of the global male audience is its active users.</p><p><strong>What to Choose?</strong></p><p>Thankfully, we now have an answer to the most sought-after debate of TikTok vs. Snapchat! If you are seeking a platform that’s more stable and widely used up by the general population, Snapchat should be your go-to app. In the past, it has offered better ROI (Return on Investment) to brands choosing to reach out to their target audience through it. And, with ad offerings on the rise here, it’s certainly more approachable to brands. But, let’s not disregard TikTok because it’s in the nascent stage. Let’s not forget that it’s a great platform to run experiments and observe the reactions of Gen-Z before reaching out to millennials. The ball is in your court now. Go for whatever seems to be the most fitting for your business and look beyond the traditional social media networks for a change to stay afloat in the market.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1993654">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993654.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1993654">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993654.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1993654%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1993654/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-insider-tips-for-documenting-your-favorite-games-on-ps4/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Insider Tips for Documenting Your Favorite Games on PS4</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-easy-to-follow-guide-to-mobile-recording-snapchat-edition/"><u>[New] In 2024, Easy-to-Follow Guide to Mobile Recording Snapchat Edition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-dailymotion-elites-in-snapchat-world/"><u>[Updated] Dailymotion Elites in Snapchat World</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-identifying-a-user-writes-silent-unseen-snapshots/"><u>[Updated] Identifying a User' Writes Silent, Unseen Snapshots</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-unlocking-creative-expression-with-simple-lenses/"><u>2024 Approved Unlocking Creative Expression with Simple Lenses</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-recovery.techidaily.com/anatomy-of-apples-proposed-domestic-robotic-aide-rumored-price-points-expected-launch-timeline-and-key-features/"><u>Anatomy of Apple's Proposed Domestic Robotic Aide: Rumored Price Points, Expected Launch Timeline & Key Features</u></a></li><li><a href="https://driver-download.techidaily.com/latest-nvidia-geforce-210-driver-upgrade-compatibility-with-windows-11/"><u>Latest Nvidia GeForce 210 Driver Upgrade: Compatibility with Windows 11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-driven-video-production.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-s-ultimate-guide-to-online-stop-motion-creation-top-picks/"><u>New 2024 Approved S Ultimate Guide to Online Stop Motion Creation Top Picks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/why-your-oneplus-ace-3-screen-might-be-unresponsive-and-how-to-fix-it-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Why Your OnePlus Ace 3 Screen Might be Unresponsive and How to Fix It | Dr.fone</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

This feature has made the app popular with young people aged 13-34 who want to communicate without leaving a permanent record.</p><p>As of May 2022, Snapchat has <a class="link"   href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/545967/snapchat-app-dau/#:~:text=How%20many%20daily%20active%20users,increase%20of%20over%2018%20percent." >347 million daily active users. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> That’s impressive growth from its humble beginnings back in 2011. With <a class="link"   href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/272014/global-social-networks-ranked-by-number-of-users/" >monthly active users of 557 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, Snapchat is ranked as the 12th most popular social media platform.</p><p>Not only that, the number of <a class="link"   href="https://www.omnicoreagency.com/snapchat-statistics/" >Snapchat daily video views is 18 billion, <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> making it the best platform to showcase your services&#x2F;products and generate more income. However, all this is only possible with the right <strong>Snapchat marketing strategy.</strong></p><h2 id="Part-2-Why-Should-Business-Market-On-Snapchat"><a href="#Part-2-Why-Should-Business-Market-On-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Why Should Business Market On Snapchat"></a>Part 2. Why Should Business Market On Snapchat</h2><p>So you are probably thinking why your business should be on Snapchat - because it’s popular with teenagers and young adults. In fact, the platform has over 347 million daily active users, with <strong>75%</strong> being under the age of 34.</p><p>Therefore, if you’re targeting a younger demographic, then Snapchat should definitely be part of your social media marketing strategy.</p><p>Another big reason is that Snapchat is incredibly engaging. The average Snapchat user opens the app at least 20 times a day and spends 25 - 30 minutes on the app each day, so that’s a lot of potential exposure for your business.</p><p>Not only that, but since Snapchat is still a new field and opened up <a class="link"   href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/20/snapchat-messaging-app-ad-creepy-ouija" >ads to users in October 2014, <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> many big companies have not entered the market. This has created a huge opportunity for small businesses to market their products and generate leads to increase their sales.</p><p>With Snapchat, you can get discovered by users in their Discovery feeds or via Stories. Also, they can interact with your brand using the Geofilters, stickers, and lenses you’ve produced during your ad campaign.</p><p>For instance, Taco Bell created a filter for Cinco de Mayo. The filter received 224 Million views, which is insane. Nevertheless, this campaign kept users engaged and helped increase Taco Bell’s sales.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/taco-bell-cinco-de-mayo-filter-on-snapchat.jpg"                      alt="taco bell cinco de mayo filter on snapchat"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135409/19272" target="_top" id="2135409">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135409" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="125" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135409/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-Where-To-Start-Your-Snapchat-Marketing-Strategy"><a href="#Part-3-Where-To-Start-Your-Snapchat-Marketing-Strategy" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

Choosing Creative Topics for Snapchat Video</h2><p>On the top of that, we will start with coming up with creative ideas for your Snapchat videos. If you’re struggling to develop <strong>ideas to post on Snapchat</strong>, don’t worry - we’ve got you covered.</p><p>Below we’ve provided some tips for your Snapchat videos:</p><h3 id="Idea-1-Conduct-Interviews-Via-Snaps"><a href="#Idea-1-Conduct-Interviews-Via-Snaps" class="headerlink" title="Idea 1. Conduct Interviews Via Snaps"></a>Idea 1. Conduct Interviews Via Snaps</h3><p>If you are running your Snapchat like a YouTube channel, conducting interviews on Snapchat is a perfect way to get quick, candid responses from your interviewees. To make it more fun, captivating, and engaging, you can also use captivating Snaps to add a personal touch.</p><p>All you need is: set lighting and sound, a 10-second snap with a question on it, and the interviewee. Start by introducing the person in the frame, put the snap on the screen, and let the interviewee answer your question.</p><p>To make things interesting, add <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >filters <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, stickers, or <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >lenses <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to reflect the scenarios or your personality.

Host A YouTube And Snapchat Q&amp;A"></a>Idea 2. Host A YouTube And Snapchat Q&amp;A</h3><p>Another great idea is to host a YouTube and Snapchat Q&amp;A. You can film with a famous snap chatter or YouTuber and ask them a few questions. You can also ask your followers&#x2F;audience to send their questions via text message or response to your stories. This will help you get your viewers involved with your content and increase engagement.</p><p>To make sure your snap Q&amp;A goes off without a hitch, be sure to:</p><ul><li>Set up your Snapchat settings of <strong>“Who Can Contact Me”</strong> to <strong>“Everyone”</strong> for a while to allow for questions.</li><li>During the session, try to acknowledge who asked the question.</li><li>After the session, change the “<strong>Who Can Contact Me”</strong> setting back to <strong>only friends</strong> to avoid spam overload.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/snapchat-qa-session-via-stories.jpg"                      alt="snapchat q a session via stories"                ></p><h3 id="Idea-3-Fun-Tidbits"><a href="#Idea-3-Fun-Tidbits" class="headerlink" title="Idea 3. Fun Tidbits"></a>Idea 3. Fun Tidbits</h3><p>Snapchat is an excellent platform to get your audience engaged with your brand by creating fun tidbits to get more traffic.</p><p>You can create short videos or images designed to be entertaining and informative. For example, Amazon’s Snapchat posts stories of their employees carving pumpkins and posting them to their followers. This is a creative and fun solution to reach new customers and create a brand personality.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/amazon-tidbit-on-snapchat.jpg"                      alt="amazon tidbit on snapchat"                ></p><h3 id="Idea-4-Behind-The-Scenes-Footage"><a href="#Idea-4-Behind-The-Scenes-Footage" class="headerlink" title="Idea 4. Behind-The-Scenes Footage"></a>Idea 4. Behind-The-Scenes Footage</h3><p>Sharing BTS footage of you and your team hard at work can be interesting and informative for your followers. This will give them a look at the inner workings of your company and how you create your products or services.

Create Title Cards For Longer Snapchat Stories"></a>Idea 1. Create Title Cards For Longer Snapchat Stories</h3><p>If you’re creating a Snapchat story that is longer than the standard 10 seconds, you can use title cards to help keep your viewers engaged.</p><p>Title cards are simply images with the text you can insert into your story to help identify what’s coming next. For example, if you’re sharing a story about your company’s history, you could use a title card at the beginning of each section to identify the different parts of the story.</p><p>For this, you can take a snap of a wall or perhaps block your camera to get a black screen and then paste your text on the picture. You can also play with the font size, style, or color to create engaging title cards.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/title-cards-for-snapchat-stories.jpg"                      alt="title cards for snapchat stories"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130875/7443" target="_top" id="2130875">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130875" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130875/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Idea-2-Adding-Music-To-Your-Video"><a href="#Idea-2-Adding-Music-To-Your-Video" class="headerlink" title="Idea 2.

In contrast, Snapchat lenses are dynamic, augmented reality animations that alter your voice along with your appearance as you move on the screen. Unlike filters that are added after taking a photo, lenses are displayed while you’re taking the photo.</p><p>The best filters on Snapchat let you change a snap’s tint or change the direction or speed in which your video is played back. On the other hand, Snapchat lenses work by utilizing facial recognition software to track your features and apply an animation that follows your facial movements. While lenses can change the sound of your voice and the appearance of your face, filters can only add color tones, messages, customized images, and icons to your snaps.</p><p>The photo and video sharing app allow you to make your own filters and lenses. Creating a filter on Snapchat isn’t free as you will have to pay a certain amount based on the filter’s square foot. However, when it comes to making your own Snapchat lens, you won’t have to pay any fees as the entire process is free.</p><h2 id="Part-2-20-Best-Filters-Lenses-On-Snapchat-to-Use-in-2021"><a href="#Part-2-20-Best-Filters-Lenses-On-Snapchat-to-Use-in-2021" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 20 Best Filters &amp; Lenses On Snapchat to Use in 2021"></a>Part 2: 20 Best Filters &amp; Lenses On Snapchat to Use in 2021</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134243/18498" target="_top" id="2134243">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134243" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134243/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Best-Snapchat-Filters-For-Selfies"><a href="#Best-Snapchat-Filters-For-Selfies" class="headerlink" title="Best Snapchat Filters For Selfies"></a>Best Snapchat Filters For Selfies</h3><p>Getting bored with the regular filters that add some brightness and little symbols to selfies?

Choosing Creative Topics for Snapchat Video"></a>Part 1. Choosing Creative Topics for Snapchat Video</h2><p>On the top of that, we will start with coming up with creative ideas for your Snapchat videos. If you’re struggling to develop <strong>ideas to post on Snapchat</strong>, don’t worry - we’ve got you covered.</p><p>Below we’ve provided some tips for your Snapchat videos:</p><h3 id="Idea-1-Conduct-Interviews-Via-Snaps"><a href="#Idea-1-Conduct-Interviews-Via-Snaps" class="headerlink" title="Idea 1. Conduct Interviews Via Snaps"></a>Idea 1. Conduct Interviews Via Snaps</h3><p>If you are running your Snapchat like a YouTube channel, conducting interviews on Snapchat is a perfect way to get quick, candid responses from your interviewees. To make it more fun, captivating, and engaging, you can also use captivating Snaps to add a personal touch.</p><p>All you need is: set lighting and sound, a 10-second snap with a question on it, and the interviewee. Start by introducing the person in the frame, put the snap on the screen, and let the interviewee answer your question.</p><p>To make things interesting, add <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >filters <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, stickers, or <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >lenses <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to reflect the scenarios or your personality. In the outro, provide a snap to thank the interviewee and share their Snapcode to let people follow them, a call to action, a positive phrase like thanks for watching, or your other social media handles.</p><h3 id="Idea-2-Host-A-YouTube-And-Snapchat-Q-A"><a href="#Idea-2-Host-A-YouTube-And-Snapchat-Q-A" class="headerlink" title="Idea 2. Host A YouTube And Snapchat Q&amp;A"></a>Idea 2. Host A YouTube And Snapchat Q&amp;A</h3><p>Another great idea is to host a YouTube and Snapchat Q&amp;A. You can film with a famous snap chatter or YouTuber and ask them a few questions. You can also ask your followers&#x2F;audience to send their questions via text message or response to your stories. This will help you get your viewers involved with your content and increase engagement.</p><p>To make sure your snap Q&amp;A goes off without a hitch, be sure to:</p><ul><li>Set up your Snapchat settings of <strong>“Who Can Contact Me”</strong> to <strong>“Everyone”</strong> for a while to allow for questions.</li><li>During the session, try to acknowledge who asked the question.</li><li>After the session, change the “<strong>Who Can Contact Me”</strong> setting back to <strong>only friends</strong> to avoid spam overload.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/snapchat-qa-session-via-stories.jpg"                      alt="snapchat q a session via stories"                ></p><h3 id="Idea-3-Fun-Tidbits"><a href="#Idea-3-Fun-Tidbits" class="headerlink" title="Idea 3. Fun Tidbits"></a>Idea 3. Fun Tidbits</h3><p>Snapchat is an excellent platform to get your audience engaged with your brand by creating fun tidbits to get more traffic.</p><p>You can create short videos or images designed to be entertaining and informative. For example, Amazon’s Snapchat posts stories of their employees carving pumpkins and posting them to their followers. This is a creative and fun solution to reach new customers and create a brand personality.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/amazon-tidbit-on-snapchat.jpg"                      alt="amazon tidbit on snapchat"                ></p><h3 id="Idea-4-Behind-The-Scenes-Footage"><a href="#Idea-4-Behind-The-Scenes-Footage" class="headerlink" title="Idea 4. Behind-The-Scenes Footage"></a>Idea 4. Behind-The-Scenes Footage</h3><p>Sharing BTS footage of you and your team hard at work can be interesting and informative for your followers. This will give them a look at the inner workings of your company and how you create your products or services. This type of content can also be used to show off your team’s personality and culture.</p><p>We have listed why Behind-the-scenes footages are useful for your reference:</p><ul><li>Helps build trust with your audience.</li><li>Allows you to humanize your brand or business and make it more relatable.</li><li>Enables you to connect with your audience on a deeper level.</li></ul><p>There are numerous ways to use BTS footage to boost your business. For example, you can use it to create a more personal connection with your customers, increase transparency and build trust.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/taco-bell-behind-the-scene-to-their-meetups.jpg"                      alt="taco bell behind the scene to their meetups"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Snapchat-Post-Ideas-for-Content-Creation"><a href="#Part-2-Snapchat-Post-Ideas-for-Content-Creation" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Create Title Cards For Longer Snapchat Stories"></a>Idea 1. Create Title Cards For Longer Snapchat Stories</h3><p>If you’re creating a Snapchat story that is longer than the standard 10 seconds, you can use title cards to help keep your viewers engaged.</p><p>Title cards are simply images with the text you can insert into your story to help identify what’s coming next. For example, if you’re sharing a story about your company’s history, you could use a title card at the beginning of each section to identify the different parts of the story.</p><p>For this, you can take a snap of a wall or perhaps block your camera to get a black screen and then paste your text on the picture. You can also play with the font size, style, or color to create engaging title cards.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/title-cards-for-snapchat-stories.jpg"                      alt="title cards for snapchat stories"                ></p><h3 id="Idea-2-Adding-Music-To-Your-Video"><a href="#Idea-2-Adding-Music-To-Your-Video" class="headerlink" title="Idea 2.

Fire Sunglasses"></a>1.  Fire Sunglasses</h4><p>Whenever the users are feeling energetic and motivated, they use the “fire sunglasses” filter. They want to show everyone that they’re on fire, and there couldn’t be a better filter than this. It provides the users with a pair of glasses with fire on the glass, which adds to the energy.</p><p>The fire on the contacts gives you a fiery and relaxed look that catches people’s attention. People can use it after their workouts or for motivational posts. This filter puts up an uplifting mood and gives you good vibes, but it might not be best suited for everyone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snapchat-fire-glasses-filter-lens.jpg"                      alt="Most popular Snapchat filters - Fire Sunglasses "                ></p><h4 id="2-Neon-Horns"><a href="#2-Neon-Horns" class="headerlink" title="2.  Neon Horns"></a>2.  Neon Horns</h4><p>The Classic filter, the devil’s horn but in neon! Incredibly catchy to the eye and gives you a devilish look. This filter is a classic and is here to stay for a long time; there’s no doubt in that.</p><p>For the first time, Horn Filters have taken one step further and given it a neon effect, making it even more appealing. The user can change the horn color; various options have been offered, such as black and white. Some more color options include lime green, magenta, orange, and light blue. It is an evergreen filter but has limited use. Want to know the best part? It sits perfectly according to your filter and does not glitch at all.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/neon-horns-snapchat-filters.jpg"                      alt="Most popular Snapchat filters - Neon Horns "                ></p><h4 id="3-Cartoon-3D-Style"><a href="#3-Cartoon-3D-Style" class="headerlink" title="3.

It gives you that unique specific animated look making you look like you just stepped out of a Disney movie.

It gets better: from children to adults, everyone has undoubtedly used this filter. This filter has a soft shading giving it that artistic look like it had been hand-drawn; it’s pretty fun when you make different faces with the filter on your face. This makes it the best filter on Snapchat!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snapchat-cartoon-3d-filter-lens.jpg"                      alt="Most popular Snapchat filters - Cartoon 3D Style "                ></p><h4 id="4-Scary-Mask"><a href="#4-Scary-Mask" class="headerlink" title="4.

But here’s the kicker: this filter covers half your face with a golden skull mask and turns your eyes into a golden flame color too.

From selfies to shots of food, videos taken during nights on the town to holiday adventures, Snapchat is the perfect video and image-sharing platform for Social Media fans.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/logo_icon/wondershare-filmora-logo-horizontal.png"                      alt="Filmora logo"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/common/filmora-product-banner.png"                      alt="filmora product interface"                ></p><h3 id="The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor"><a href="#The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor"></a>The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Record PC screen <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, voiceover, and webcam simultaneously</li><li>Edit recorded clips quickly with a wide range of professional tools</li><li>Built-in plentiful templates and effects</li><li>Export to MP4, MOV, MKV, GIF and multiple formats</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static.wondershare.com/images-filmora/images/common/securety.svg"                      alt="secure download"                >Secure Download</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2052062/7443" target="_top" id="2052062">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2052062" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2052062/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-screenshot-on-snapchat-without-stimulating-a-notification"><a href="#How-to-screenshot-on-snapchat-without-stimulating-a-notification" class="headerlink" title="How to screenshot on snapchat without stimulating a notification?"></a>How to screenshot on snapchat without stimulating a notification?</h2><p>An incredible application that allows you to send and share videos and images with friends and followers, Snapchat is designed to help you stay connected in more ways than one. Featuring an anti-screenshot notification system that automatically notifies posters when a recipient or audience member screenshots a snap, it’s become increasingly harder to screenshot without being detected.</p><p>That being said, there are still plenty of other methods that offer a practical alternative to ensure you avoid that awkward automated notification.</p><h4 id="Option-1-Use-Another-Phone-or-Mobile-Device-to-Take-Snapchat-Screenshot"><a href="#Option-1-Use-Another-Phone-or-Mobile-Device-to-Take-Snapchat-Screenshot" class="headerlink" title="Option 1. Use Another Phone or Mobile Device to Take Snapchat Screenshot"></a>Option 1. Use Another Phone or Mobile Device to Take Snapchat Screenshot</h4><p>An easy and risk-free way to capture and store a specific snap with ease, utilizing another mobile device or camera is a great method that requires very little effort. Simply us a second phone, or a nearby tablet, to record the whole duration of the video or photo.</p><p>Although the quality of the recording won’t be as crisp and clear as it appears on the handheld, this is a reliable and fool-proof way to preserve those special snaps. From those video recordings, you should then be able to crop out the video or image you needed.</p><p>Missed it?</p><p>Why not take advantage of Snapchat’s “replay” mode to ensure you get the perfect shot – but be warned, posters also get notified of this too.</p><h4 id="Option-2-Use-the-Built-In-Screen-Recoding-Tool-on-iOS11"><a href="#Option-2-Use-the-Built-In-Screen-Recoding-Tool-on-iOS11" class="headerlink" title="Option 2. Use the Built-In Screen Recoding Tool on iOS11"></a>Option 2. Use the Built-In Screen Recoding Tool on iOS11</h4><p>If you didn’t already know, there’s a built-in screen recording software within iOS11 that allows you to effectively capture and record snaps with ease. Lying within the Settings of any iPhone, follow these easy steps on how to live record your screen:</p><ul><li>Step 1: Head to Settings &gt; Control Centre &gt; Customize Controls</li><li>Step 2: Locate the “Screen Recording” functionality</li><li>Step 3: Select the small cross to add it to your Control Centre</li><li>Step 4: To activate – Tap the icon with the 2 concentric circles to start recording. To complete a recording, simply tap the red bar that’s present at the top of the screen and select “End Recording”.</li></ul><p>Although it’s not possible to start recording a snap whilst it’s already open, it’s best to start recording before you opt to open a specific message.</p><p>Please note: If you have updated to Snapchat version 10.17.5, the posters will be notified each and every time you initiate and capture a recording through the use of this built-in recorder.</p><h4 id="Option-3-Use-QuickTime-Screen-Capture-on-a-Mac"><a href="#Option-3-Use-QuickTime-Screen-Capture-on-a-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Option 3. Use QuickTime Screen Capture on a Mac"></a>Option 3. Use QuickTime Screen Capture on a Mac</h4><p>A little more technical than simply using another mobile device to record a snap, using the QuickTime Player is an efficient and high-quality method for those looking to secretly store a snapchat post.</p><p>To start recording snaps, follow these simple steps:</p><ul><li>Step 1: Connect your iPhone to your Mac</li><li>Step 2: Open the QuickTime Player application</li><li>Step 3: Select <strong>File &gt; New Movie Recording</strong> from the menu</li><li>Step 4: Once loaded, simply hover the mouse beside the recording button. By clicking the small arrow, you’ll be provided with a range of different recording options</li><li>Step 5: Select your Phone as the <strong>Movie Recording Input</strong></li></ul><p>Once connected, your Mac screen should now be mirroring your mobile device. Just like you would on your phone, simply hit record and head on over to the Snapchat application to begin recording.</p><h4 id="Option-4-Use-the-Mirror-Feature-for-Android"><a href="#Option-4-Use-the-Mirror-Feature-for-Android" class="headerlink" title="Option 4. Use the Mirror Feature for Android"></a>Option 4. Use the Mirror Feature for Android</h4><p>Similar to the use of QuickTime or the iOS11 Screen Recording software, Screen Mirroring is another effective method for capturing Snapchat screenshots without the poster being made aware. By connecting a HDMI cable to both your TV and laptop, or by accessing the “Screen Mirroring” application that’s often built-in to most Smart Phones and Android devices, it’s possible to mirror&#x2F;cast the active screen on your device onto an external platform.</p><p>In doing so, you’re presented with the opportunity to utilize another device to record a playing snap or even share a recently received snap with other audience members that are present in the room.</p><h4 id="Option-5-Delay-the-Snapchat-Screenshot-Notification"><a href="#Option-5-Delay-the-Snapchat-Screenshot-Notification" class="headerlink" title="Option 5. Delay the Snapchat Screenshot Notification"></a>Option 5. Delay the Snapchat Screenshot Notification</h4><p>A method for those feeling a more confident or even for those that aren’t too bothered about their posters receiving a notification in the long run, this method is a great way to delay the arrival of that pop-down notification.</p><p>To delay the notification process, follow these simple steps:</p><ul><li>Step 1: Load the Snapchat application on your mobile device</li><li>Step 2: Find the snap you want to open&#x2F;record (ensure it is fully loaded)</li><li>Step 3: Turn off WiFi, Bluetooth, Mobile Data</li><li>Step 4: Turn on the Airplane Mode</li><li>Step 5: Open the snap and take your screenshot</li><li>Step 6: Wait approximately 30 seconds and then turn all your connections back on</li></ul><p>Designed to postpone the process of the poster receiving a notification, but not allowing for viewers to screenshot undetected, this method allows audience members to screenshot snaps from those that are perhaps a little unobservant when it comes to checking their notifications.</p><p>Be warned though, some posters may catch on to this method of screenshotting and they may stop sharing their videos and images with you.</p><!-- affiliate

id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>Despite there being plenty of reasons why there might be a need for you to record a Snapchat memory without the sender being made aware, it’s important to note that this can also be viewed as a breach of privacy with senders not only being informed of who has taken a screenshot, but also how many times they’ve done so and of which post.</p><p>With Snapchat designed to maintain the notion that any media sent between users is considered temporary, thanks to the 5-10 second duration limit, the methods listed above, although not fail-proof, are suggested as simple yet effective ways to avoid triggering an unwanted notification whilst using this highly popular social networking application.</p><p><a

This self-deleting feature deters users from <strong>saving Snapchat videos</strong> of their friends. Snapchat photos, videos, and stories of contacts vanish from storyboard right after you view them.</p><p> So, what will you do to save photos or videos from your friends’ Snapchat or Snap Stories long before they are gone? You can take a screenshot, save in flight mode, use your computer, or an app to capture the videos and images.</p><p> Through this article, we are going to tell you, how to save Snapchats to your phone to make you watch them later.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1"><strong>Part1: How to Save Snapchats without them knowing</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part2"><strong>Part2: How to save Snapchat videos on Mac</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part3"><strong>Part3: How to save Snapchat videos on Android</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part4"><strong>Part4: How to save Snapchat videos to your Phone</strong></a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Save-Snapchats-without-them-knowing"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Save-Snapchats-without-them-knowing" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Save Snapchats without them knowing"></a>Part 1: How to Save Snapchats without them knowing</h2><p> You want to save a friend’s Snaps, but Snapchat immediately alerts them of the screen shot taken. Hence, it is not possible to save other’s pictures or videos in Snapchat in incognito mode. You don’t need apps to save Snapchat to your phone. There is hardly a feasible way to do so without the senders’ knowledge. In such a situation, you can try out the following option – saving Snaps in flight mode.</p><p> Here are the steps</p><ol><li>First of all, launch the Snapchat app on your mobile phone and leave it open. Go to your phone’s ‘Settings’ (Android&#x2F;iPhone) and toggle on the ‘Airplane&#x2F;Flight’ mode. Airplane&#x2F;Flight mode disables all the wireless connections, be it network signals or internet related services for your device (Wi-Fi as well as cellular).</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snapchat-save-without-knowing.JPG"                      alt="snapchat save without knowing"                ></p><ol start="2"><li>Browse the Snapchat inbox and view the desired Snap that you wish to save, and quickly take a screenshot. Make sure to be quick enough and do it before the Snap expires.</li><li>Now, logout from your Snapchat account right after taking the screenshot.

For example, if you start your streak on your birthday, you’ll always remember to keep the streak going on, and it will also help you to grab the attention of people.</p><p><strong>Idea 2. Memorable Day</strong></p><p>We all have memorable days in our lives, like a milestone, graduation, or special event that we want to remember forever. What is a better way to commemorate them than with a Snap? Your friends and family will appreciate it, and you will be able to keep your streak alive for days to come.</p><p><strong>Idea 3. Streak While Traveling</strong></p><p>Whenever you are on a trip, travel to your office&#x2F;college, or head out to run some errands, remember to take a picture of the surroundings that look interesting and send it to whom you are establishing the streak.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/send-snapstreak-while-traveling.jpg"                      alt="send snapstreak while traveling"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2100541/7443" target="_top" id="2100541">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2100541" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2100541/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Tip-3-Organize-Your-Snapchat-And-Your-Time"><a href="#Tip-3-Organize-Your-Snapchat-And-Your-Time" class="headerlink" title="Tip 3. Organize Your Snapchat And Your Time"></a>Tip 3. Organize Your Snapchat And Your Time</h3><p>Are you trying to get the most out of Snapchat without letting it take over your life? Below we’ve provided some ideas to help you organize your time and your snaps.</p><p><strong>Idea 1. Edit the Name of your Snapchat Friends</strong></p><p>To avoid losing your Snapchat streaks with any of your contacts, you should start editing their names. Snapchat lists your most contacted friends at the top, so you might not see the others who are lower on your list. Editing their names to include something that will help you search for them will make it easier to avoid forgetting to send them a snap regularly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/edit-the-name-of-your-snapchat-friend.jpg"                      alt="edit the name of your snapchat friend"                ></p><p><strong>Idea 2. Pin Your Conversations</strong></p><p>If you want to keep someone at the top of your chat list, consider pinning their chat. This will also ultimately help you send snaps to them without breaking the streak.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/pin-conversation-in-snapchat.jpg"                      alt="pin conversation in snapchat"                ></p><p><strong>Idea 3. Stick to a Particular Time of the Day</strong></p><p>You will gain more by starting your Snapstreaks later on in the day, especially if you are only sending one snap per day. This way, the hourglass emoji will be visible for a considerable amount of time before it expires.</p><p><strong>Idea 4. Check Your Filters</strong></p><p>If you’re trying to keep up with multiple Snapstreaks at once, it’s easy to forget who you’re on a streak with. But there’s a way to see them without going to your list of friends.</p><p>Whenever you’re about to send a new snap, swipe through the filters. Here, you’ll see a special Snapchat streak filter, which will show how many consecutive days of successful streak you have in big white numbers next to the fire emoji.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>In this article, we’ve compiled a list of fun and creative <strong>Snapchat streak ideas</strong> to help you stay connected with your friends.</p><p>Hopefully, by following these tips, you can now keep your Snapchat streak alive and stay connected with your contacts in a better and more engaging way!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134239/18498" target="_top" id="2134239">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134239" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="721" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134239/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Steps-for-Retrieving-Personal-Hidden-Snapchat-Photos"><a href="#Steps-for-Retrieving-Personal-Hidden-Snapchat-Photos" class="headerlink" title="Steps for Retrieving Personal, Hidden Snapchat Photos"></a>Steps for Retrieving Personal, Hidden Snapchat Photos</h2><p>Have you ever set some of your Snapchat pictures to “My Eyes Only” and then accidentally deleted them?

Featuring an anti-screenshot notification system that automatically notifies posters when a recipient or audience member screenshots a snap, it’s become increasingly harder to screenshot without being detected.</p><p>That being said, there are still plenty of other methods that offer a practical alternative to ensure you avoid that awkward automated notification.</p><h4 id="Option-1-Use-Another-Phone-or-Mobile-Device-to-Take-Snapchat-Screenshot"><a href="#Option-1-Use-Another-Phone-or-Mobile-Device-to-Take-Snapchat-Screenshot" class="headerlink" title="Option 1. Use Another Phone or Mobile Device to Take Snapchat Screenshot"></a>Option 1. Use Another Phone or Mobile Device to Take Snapchat Screenshot</h4><p>An easy and risk-free way to capture and store a specific snap with ease, utilizing another mobile device or camera is a great method that requires very little effort. Simply us a second phone, or a nearby tablet, to record the whole duration of the video or photo.</p><p>Although the quality of the recording won’t be as crisp and clear as it appears on the handheld, this is a reliable and fool-proof way to preserve those special snaps. From those video recordings, you should then be able to crop out the video or image you needed.</p><p>Missed it?</p><p>Why not take advantage of Snapchat’s “replay” mode to ensure you get the perfect shot – but be warned, posters also get notified of this too.</p><h4 id="Option-2-Use-the-Built-In-Screen-Recoding-Tool-on-iOS11"><a href="#Option-2-Use-the-Built-In-Screen-Recoding-Tool-on-iOS11" class="headerlink" title="Option 2. Use the Built-In Screen Recoding Tool on iOS11"></a>Option 2. Use the Built-In Screen Recoding Tool on iOS11</h4><p>If you didn’t already know, there’s a built-in screen recording software within iOS11 that allows you to effectively capture and record snaps with ease. Lying within the Settings of any iPhone, follow these easy steps on how to live record your screen:</p><ul><li>Step 1: Head to Settings &gt; Control Centre &gt; Customize Controls</li><li>Step 2: Locate the “Screen Recording” functionality</li><li>Step 3: Select the small cross to add it to your Control Centre</li><li>Step 4: To activate – Tap the icon with the 2 concentric circles to start recording. To complete a recording, simply tap the red bar that’s present at the top of the screen and select “End Recording”.</li></ul><p>Although it’s not possible to start recording a snap whilst it’s already open, it’s best to start recording before you opt to open a specific message.</p><p>Please note: If you have updated to Snapchat version 10.17.5, the posters will be notified each and every time you initiate and capture a recording through the use of this built-in recorder.</p><h4 id="Option-3-Use-QuickTime-Screen-Capture-on-a-Mac"><a href="#Option-3-Use-QuickTime-Screen-Capture-on-a-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Option 3. Use QuickTime Screen Capture on a Mac"></a>Option 3. Use QuickTime Screen Capture on a Mac</h4><p>A little more technical than simply using another mobile device to record a snap, using the QuickTime Player is an efficient and high-quality method for those looking to secretly store a snapchat post.</p><p>To start recording snaps, follow these simple steps:</p><ul><li>Step 1: Connect your iPhone to your Mac</li><li>Step 2: Open the QuickTime Player application</li><li>Step 3: Select <strong>File &gt; New Movie Recording</strong> from the menu</li><li>Step 4: Once loaded, simply hover the mouse beside the recording button. By clicking the small arrow, you’ll be provided with a range of different recording options</li><li>Step 5: Select your Phone as the <strong>Movie Recording Input</strong></li></ul><p>Once connected, your Mac screen should now be mirroring your mobile device. Just like you would on your phone, simply hit record and head on over to the Snapchat application to begin recording.</p><h4 id="Option-4-Use-the-Mirror-Feature-for-Android"><a href="#Option-4-Use-the-Mirror-Feature-for-Android" class="headerlink" title="Option 4. Use the Mirror Feature for Android"></a>Option 4. Use the Mirror Feature for Android</h4><p>Similar to the use of QuickTime or the iOS11 Screen Recording software, Screen Mirroring is another effective method for capturing Snapchat screenshots without the poster being made aware. By connecting a HDMI cable to both your TV and laptop, or by accessing the “Screen Mirroring” application that’s often built-in to most Smart Phones and Android devices, it’s possible to mirror&#x2F;cast the active screen on your device onto an external platform.</p><p>In doing so, you’re presented with the opportunity to utilize another device to record a playing snap or even share a recently received snap with other audience members that are present in the room.</p><h4 id="Option-5-Delay-the-Snapchat-Screenshot-Notification"><a href="#Option-5-Delay-the-Snapchat-Screenshot-Notification" class="headerlink" title="Option 5. Delay the Snapchat Screenshot Notification"></a>Option 5. Delay the Snapchat Screenshot Notification</h4><p>A method for those feeling a more confident or even for those that aren’t too bothered about their posters receiving a notification in the long run, this method is a great way to delay the arrival of that pop-down notification.</p><p>To delay the notification process, follow these simple steps:</p><ul><li>Step 1: Load the Snapchat application on your mobile device</li><li>Step 2: Find the snap you want to open&#x2F;record (ensure it is fully loaded)</li><li>Step 3: Turn off WiFi, Bluetooth, Mobile Data</li><li>Step 4: Turn on the Airplane Mode</li><li>Step 5: Open the snap and take your screenshot</li><li>Step 6: Wait approximately 30 seconds and then turn all your connections back on</li></ul><p>Designed to postpone the process of the poster receiving a notification, but not allowing for viewers to screenshot undetected, this method allows audience members to screenshot snaps from those that are perhaps a little unobservant when it comes to checking their notifications.</p><p>Be warned though, some posters may catch on to this method of screenshotting and they may stop sharing their videos and images with you.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1934258/19272" target="_top" id="1934258">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1934258" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1934258/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>Despite there being plenty of reasons why there might be a need for you to record a Snapchat memory without the sender being made aware, it’s important to note that this can also be viewed as a breach of privacy with senders not only being informed of who has taken a screenshot, but also how many times they’ve done so and of which post.</p><p>With Snapchat designed to maintain the notion that any media sent between users is considered temporary, thanks to the 5-10 second duration limit, the methods listed above, although not fail-proof, are suggested as simple yet effective ways to avoid triggering an unwanted notification whilst using this highly popular social networking application.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-blue-scrn-win.png"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-blue-scrn-mac.png"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037475/7443" target="_top" id="2037475">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037475" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037475/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1982508">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982508.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1982508">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982508.png"                      style="border: none;
