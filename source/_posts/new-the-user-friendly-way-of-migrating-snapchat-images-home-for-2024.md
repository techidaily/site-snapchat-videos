## The Things You Should Know About Snapchat Streaks

Snapchat streaks are a popular way to stay connected with friends on the app. But what are Snapstreaks, and how do they work?

Below, we'll give you a quick rundown of everything you need to know about Snapchat streaks.

### (1) What Will Not Be Counted Towards Snapchat Streaks

We all know how important it is to keep up our Snapchat streaks - after all, it's a way to show how close we are to someone! But there are a few things that won't count towards your Snapstreak, even if you're still talking to your friends every day.

* **Chatting:** If you're just chatting with someone without exchanging any snaps, that won't count towards your streaks.
* **Story**: Views of your Story don't count, but if you reply to someone's story with a snap, that will keep your streaks going.
* **Memories**: Any picture from your Memories vault will not be considered a Snapstreak.
* **Group Chat:** Group chats, whether text-based or Snaps, do not contribute to a Streak.
* **Snapchat Spectacle:** Any snap sent through Snapchat spectacle won't be considered a Snapstreak interaction.

Many people choose to start their streaks on special days because it helps them remember to keep them alive. For example, if you start your streak on your birthday, you'll always remember to keep the streak going on, and it will also help you to grab the attention of people.

**Idea 2\. Memorable Day**

We all have memorable days in our lives, like a milestone, graduation, or special event that we want to remember forever. What is a better way to commemorate them than with a Snap? Your friends and family will appreciate it, and you will be able to keep your streak alive for days to come.

Whenever you are on a trip, travel to your office/college, or head out to run some errands, remember to take a picture of the surroundings that look interesting and send it to whom you are establishing the streak.

### Tip 3\. Organize Your Snapchat And Your Time

Are you trying to get the most out of Snapchat without letting it take over your life? Below we've provided some ideas to help you organize your time and your snaps.

**Idea 1\. Edit the Name of your Snapchat Friends**

To avoid losing your Snapchat streaks with any of your contacts, you should start editing their names. Snapchat lists your most contacted friends at the top, so you might not see the others who are lower on your list. Editing their names to include something that will help you search for them will make it easier to avoid forgetting to send them a snap regularly.

![edit the name of your snapchat friend](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/edit-the-name-of-your-snapchat-friend.jpg)

**Idea 2\. Pin Your Conversations**

If you want to keep someone at the top of your chat list, consider pinning their chat. This will also ultimately help you send snaps to them without breaking the streak.

![pin conversation in snapchat](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/pin-conversation-in-snapchat.jpg)

**Idea 3\. Stick to a Particular Time of the Day**

You will gain more by starting your Snapstreaks later on in the day, especially if you are only sending one snap per day. This way, the hourglass emoji will be visible for a considerable amount of time before it expires.

**Idea 4\. Check Your Filters**

If you're trying to keep up with multiple Snapstreaks at once, it's easy to forget who you're on a streak with. But there's a way to see them without going to your list of friends.

Whenever you're about to send a new snap, swipe through the filters. Here, you'll see a special Snapchat streak filter, which will show how many consecutive days of successful streak you have in big white numbers next to the fire emoji.

## Conclusion

In this article, we've compiled a list of fun and creative **Snapchat streak ideas** to help you stay connected with your friends.

Hopefully, by following these tips, you can now keep your Snapchat streak alive and stay connected with your contacts in a better and more engaging way!
