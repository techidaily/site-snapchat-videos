## Snapshot Strategies: Maintaining Consistent Snapstreaks

With over 347million daily users, Snapchat is one of the most popular social media platforms out there, especially among millennials, and one of the things that makes it unique is its Streaks.

For those who don't have any idea about Snapchat streaks, they are essentially a measure of how often you and your friends send Snaps to each other within a 24-hour period. The longer the streak, the more points you earn.

In this article, we'll give you some **Snapchat streak ideas** to help you keep them alive and show your dedication to your friends.

## The Things You Should Know About Snapchat Streaks

Snapchat streaks are a popular way to stay connected with friends on the app. But what are Snapstreaks, and how do they work?

Below, we'll give you a quick rundown of everything you need to know about Snapchat streaks.

### (1) What Will Not Be Counted Towards Snapchat Streaks

We all know how important it is to keep up our Snapchat streaks - after all, it's a way to show how close we are to someone! But there are a few things that won't count towards your Snapstreak, even if you're still talking to your friends every day.

* **Chatting:** If you're just chatting with someone without exchanging any snaps, that won't count towards your streaks.
* **Story**: Views of your Story don't count, but if you reply to someone's story with a snap, that will keep your streaks going.
* **Memories**: Any picture from your Memories vault will not be considered a Snapstreak.
* **Group Chat:** Group chats, whether text-based or Snaps, do not contribute to a Streak.
* **Snapchat Spectacle:** Any snap sent through Snapchat spectacle won't be considered a Snapstreak interaction.

### (2) The Emojis Relevant To Snapchat Streak

There are many new emojis on Snapchat that you can use in your snaps to communicate with your friends or family in a whole new way. However, only a handful of them is related to Snapstreaks.

Here's a list of the emojis relevant to Snapchat Streak and what they mean:

* **Fire:** When you send Snaps to a contract for three consecutive days, a fire emoji will appear next to the person's name, indicating a streak has started.
* **100:** This emoji appears if you send one snap every day for 100 days.
* **Hourglass:** When you don't send a snap within 24 hours to someone that you have started the streak with, an hourglass emoji will appear next to the person's name, indicating that the Snapstreak is about to end.
* **Face with Sunglasses**: This emoji reflects that you and your friends are mutual besties.
* **Hearts:** There are three kinds of heart emojis: Double Pink Hearts, Red, and Yellow. The former indicates Super BFF, while the second shows that you and your friend are BFFs. The third one is for Besties.
* **Mountain**: Many claims that a unicorn-type emoji will appear when you have a very long steak but details of this emoji are not available in Snapchat documentation.
* **Smiling Face**: This emoji appears when you and your friends are best friends.

### Tip 1\. Ideas To Create And Send Snaps Quickly

Below are some tips/ideas to help you quickly create and send Snaps to keep your Snapchat streak alive:

**Idea 1\. Edit Blank Snap And Send As New Snap**

**Idea 3\. Use Emojis And Bitmojis**

You can also add emojis or Bitmojis to your photos to make them look more interesting and fun. Simply open up the Snapchat app, click a picture, and tap on the emoji icon to select the emoji or Bitmoji that you want to add to your Snap. You can even resize and move them around to get it just right.

**Idea 4\. Snap With Your Pets**

We all love our pets - and we also like staying connected with our friends on Snapchat. So why not combine the two? Occasionally take a picture of your pet using the app and send it to your besties to make their day and keep the streak alive!

![streak daily food](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/streak-daily-food.jpg)

### Tip 2\. Seize Occasions And Keep Your Snapchat Sneak Alive

To keep your Snapchat streak alive, try to seize any opportunity you can to take pictures and send them to friends. Below are some ideas to do this:

**Idea 1\. The First Day Matters**

Many people choose to start their streaks on special days because it helps them remember to keep them alive. For example, if you start your streak on your birthday, you'll always remember to keep the streak going on, and it will also help you to grab the attention of people.

**Idea 2\. Memorable Day**

We all have memorable days in our lives, like a milestone, graduation, or special event that we want to remember forever. What is a better way to commemorate them than with a Snap? Your friends and family will appreciate it, and you will be able to keep your streak alive for days to come.

**Idea 3\. Streak While Traveling**

Whenever you are on a trip, travel to your office/college, or head out to run some errands, remember to take a picture of the surroundings that look interesting and send it to whom you are establishing the streak.

![send snapstreak while traveling](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/send-snapstreak-while-traveling.jpg)

### Tip 3\. Organize Your Snapchat And Your Time

Are you trying to get the most out of Snapchat without letting it take over your life? Below we've provided some ideas to help you organize your time and your snaps.

**Idea 1\. Edit the Name of your Snapchat Friends**

To avoid losing your Snapchat streaks with any of your contacts, you should start editing their names. Snapchat lists your most contacted friends at the top, so you might not see the others who are lower on your list. Editing their names to include something that will help you search for them will make it easier to avoid forgetting to send them a snap regularly.

![edit the name of your snapchat friend](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/edit-the-name-of-your-snapchat-friend.jpg)

**Idea 2\. Pin Your Conversations**

If you want to keep someone at the top of your chat list, consider pinning their chat. This will also ultimately help you send snaps to them without breaking the streak.

![pin conversation in snapchat](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/pin-conversation-in-snapchat.jpg)

**Idea 3\. Stick to a Particular Time of the Day**

You will gain more by starting your Snapstreaks later on in the day, especially if you are only sending one snap per day. This way, the hourglass emoji will be visible for a considerable amount of time before it expires.

**Idea 4\. Check Your Filters**

If you're trying to keep up with multiple Snapstreaks at once, it's easy to forget who you're on a streak with. But there's a way to see them without going to your list of friends.

Whenever you're about to send a new snap, swipe through the filters. Here, you'll see a special Snapchat streak filter, which will show how many consecutive days of successful streak you have in big white numbers next to the fire emoji.

## Conclusion

In this article, we've compiled a list of fun and creative **Snapchat streak ideas** to help you stay connected with your friends.

Hopefully, by following these tips, you can now keep your Snapchat streak alive and stay connected with your contacts in a better and more engaging way!

**Snapchat** is one of the most popular social media platforms of the present time and certainly needs no introduction. Though, to rival other apps like Instagram and TikTok, Snapchat has recently added a “Sound” feature. With this newly-added option, users can add music to a Snapchat video pretty easily and make their snaps more interesting. In this post, I’m going to let you know how to add music to a Snapchat video without any hassle. Let’s get it started and level-up your Snapchat game!

## Part 1: What's the Sound Feature in Snapchat?

Before we learn how to add music to your Snapchat video, let’s quickly get to know about the “Sounds” feature of the app. If you have been using Instagram or TikTok, then you might be familiar with their music feature.

Similarly, in 2020, Snapchat has also included a Sound feature that lets us add music to our snaps (photos or videos). For this, you can integrate Snapchat with a streaming service like Spotify, Pandora, Apple Music, or Soundcloud. While it doesn’t include all sorts of tracks, you can find most of the popular songs so that you can easily add music to a Snapchat video and make it interesting.

Once the other person would view your snap, they can hear the music playing in the background. If they want to listen to it or know more about the song, then they can just tap on its sticker on your snap.

## Part 2: How to Add Music to a Snapchat Video on iPhone or Android?

One of the best things about Snapchat is that the overall interface of the app is pretty similar for both iOS and Android versions. Therefore, to learn how to add music on a Snapchat video, you need to follow the same process. As of now, you can find almost all the popular songs on Snapchat and can even record your own sounds.

To learn how to add music to your Snapchat video on your Android or iOS device, you can just follow this simple drill.

**Step 1: Visit the Snapchat Sound section on the app**

At first, just launch the Snapchat application on your device and tap on the camera icon from the home to start recording.

Using the rear or front camera of your device, you can now record any video on Snapchat. Once the video is recorded, you can tap on the music icon from the sidebar to add a song to a Snapchat video.

**Step 2: Search for any music to include in your Snaps**

As you would tap on the **Music** icon, you can view a list of various songs supported by Snapchat. If you want to look for anything specific, then just tap on the search icon and enter keywords to find a song of your choice.

Afterward, Snapchat will list the searched results, and you can tap on the play icon to first listen to the song. Just tap on the icon of the song and click on the “Next” button from the bottom to include it in the snap.

**Step 3: Trim and add the song to your Snapchat video**

Now, Snapchat will automatically display the snippet of the music at the bottom. You can use the left or the right slider option to trim the section of the music you want to add. Here, you also can tap on the play icon to listen to the track first.

**Step 4: Add music to your Snapchat video after recording**

That’s it! Once you have trimmed the music snippet, you can post it. You can tap on the shutter or the download icon first to save the video on your phone.

Now, you can preview the music via its sticker. You can just tap on the music sticker to change its appearance or drag it on the screen to place it anywhere you like. To change its size, you can just pinch-in or pinch-out the sticker.

In the end, just tap on the send icon to post your snap. You can add it to your story or sent it to any Snapchat contact. When they would open it, they can listen to the added song and even tap on the sticker to load it.

In this way, anyone can learn how to put music on a Snapchat video without any hassle.

## Part 3: FAQs on Adding Music to a Snapchat Video

Now when you know how to add music to your Snapchat video, let’s clear some common doubts related to it.

* **How to add your own music to a Snapchat video?**

Apart from the available songs on Snapchat, the app also lets us add the sound of our choice. For this, just click on the music icon and tap the “Create Sound” button instead. This will let you record anything or create your own music on Snapchat.

* **Why are some songs not available on Snapchat?**

The Sound feature of Snapchat only provides licensed music by collaborating with some of the biggest record labels. Therefore, while you can find most of the popular songs, chances are that some of them might be missing from the collection.

* **Why can’t I add music to my Snapchat videos?**

Well, there could be two possible reasons for this – you might be using an old version of Snapchat or the feature might not be available in your region yet. To fix this, you can just go to the Snapchat page on the App/Play Store and tap on the “Update” button. Furthermore, if the Sound feature has not been rolled out to your region, then you can just wait for a while.

As you can see, it is pretty easy to learn how to add music to a Snapchat video like a pro.

Furthermore, if the Sound feature has not been rolled out to your region, then you can just wait for a while.

As you can see, it is pretty easy to learn how to add music to a Snapchat video like a pro. With the newly-added Sounds feature, it is pretty easy to add a song to your Snapchat videos and make them more interesting. Go ahead and try this feature to make your snaps creative and share this guide with others to teach them how do you add music to a Snapchat video as well.
