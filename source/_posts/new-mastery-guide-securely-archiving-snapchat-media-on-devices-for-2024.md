## Part 1\. Snapchat Overview

Firstly, let's have an overview of Snapchat before we see how to draw your blueprint in Part 3 and Part 4.

Snapchat - founded by Evan Spiegel, Bobby Murphy, and Reggie Brown - is a unique messaging app because it allows users to send disappearing messages and photos. This feature has made the app popular with young people aged 13-34 who want to communicate without leaving a permanent record.

As of May 2022, Snapchat has [347 million daily active users.](https://www.statista.com/statistics/545967/snapchat-app-dau/#:~:text=How%20many%20daily%20active%20users,increase%20of%20over%2018%20percent.) That's impressive growth from its humble beginnings back in 2011\. With [monthly active users of 557](https://www.statista.com/statistics/272014/global-social-networks-ranked-by-number-of-users/), Snapchat is ranked as the 12th most popular social media platform.

Not only that, the number of [Snapchat daily video views is 18 billion,](https://www.omnicoreagency.com/snapchat-statistics/) making it the best platform to showcase your services/products and generate more income. However, all this is only possible with the right **Snapchat marketing strategy.**

## Part 2\. Why Should Business Market On Snapchat

So you are probably thinking why your business should be on Snapchat - because it's popular with teenagers and young adults. In fact, the platform has over 347 million daily active users, with **75%** being under the age of 34.

Therefore, if you're targeting a younger demographic, then Snapchat should definitely be part of your social media marketing strategy.

Another big reason is that Snapchat is incredibly engaging. The average Snapchat user opens the app at least 20 times a day and spends 25 - 30 minutes on the app each day, so that's a lot of potential exposure for your business.

Not only that, but since Snapchat is still a new field and opened up [ads to users in October 2014,](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/20/snapchat-messaging-app-ad-creepy-ouija) many big companies have not entered the market. This has created a huge opportunity for small businesses to market their products and generate leads to increase their sales.

With Snapchat, you can get discovered by users in their Discovery feeds or via Stories. Also, they can interact with your brand using the Geofilters, stickers, and lenses you've produced during your ad campaign.

For instance, Taco Bell created a filter for Cinco de Mayo. The filter received 224 Million views, which is insane. Nevertheless, this campaign kept users engaged and helped increase Taco Bell's sales.

### Track and Measure your Marketing Results

You've created a Snapchat marketing strategy and are ready to start reaching your target audience. But how will you monitor if your marketing efforts are successful? The key is to track and measure your results so that you can make adjustments as needed.

While Snapchat doesn't offer robust analytics data, you can track the following metrics to monitor the results:

* By checking the number of views on your stories and ads to see how many people are viewing them.
* Check the length of the Story that received more viewers and try to make future ads and stories of the same length.
* Monitor the number of views on your First Snap and Last Snap and check whether the views are increasing or not.
* Analyze Engagement (the number of screenshots or direct messages) on your ads and stories. This will clearly tell you about your performance.
* Check the completion Rate (percentage of users who watched your stories and compare it with the increase in sales to see whether you are performing well or not.

Do the following steps to set up snap code for your business account:

Step1 Launch the **Snapchat** app (your business Snapchat account) and on the top-left side of your screen, tap the **Ghost/Profile** icon.

Step2 Now, tap the **Settings** icons, find the **"Snapcodes"** option and tap it. Select the **"Create Snapcodes"** option, add your URL, and tap **"Create."**

Here are a few tips and approaches to help you create a Snapchat story that will capture your audience's attention:

* **Be creative**: Use Snapchat's unique features, such as filters and augmented reality, to create a story that is truly one of a kind.

### How To Advertise With Snapchat

Snapchat Ads are a form of advertisement that allows businesses to reach out to Snapchat users with creative and interactive content. These ads can take the form of filters, lenses, or Geofilters and can be targeted to specific users based on their interests and location.

Snapchat ads are a great way to reach a new audience and promote your business in a fun and engaging way. To learn how to create stunning and effective Snapchat ads, please read[Snapchat Ad 101](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

### Sponsored Geofilters

Geofilters are location-specific AR filters that you can create on-demand for your business to attract more customers. These filters can cost you **$5 to $20** depending upon the area/ square feet and duration, but they will surely help you attract more customers, resulting in more revenue.

### Sponsored Lenses

Sponsored lenses are AR filters businesses produce to interact with their users on Snapchat. Users can use these lenses to make inspiring snaps, send them to friends or have fun playing games using the gamified lenses.

For instance, Sephora created a gamified AR experience for their advertisement campaign on Snapchat. They provide coupons and promo codes to the users who completed the game. This helped them boost their products' sales and ultimately generate more sales.

### Snapchat Discover

Snapchat Discover is a feature that helps brands to publish stories on the Snapchat app. This content is designed to be consumed in short, snackable bites - perfect for the attention-deficient millennial.

You can get almost 2 times more traffic on your website by having a channel on Snapchat Discover and sharing engaging content with clickable links.

### Track and Measure your Marketing Results

You've created a Snapchat marketing strategy and are ready to start reaching your target audience. But how will you monitor if your marketing efforts are successful? The key is to track and measure your results so that you can make adjustments as needed.

While Snapchat doesn't offer robust analytics data, you can track the following metrics to monitor the results:

* By checking the number of views on your stories and ads to see how many people are viewing them.
* Check the length of the Story that received more viewers and try to make future ads and stories of the same length.
* Monitor the number of views on your First Snap and Last Snap and check whether the views are increasing or not.
* Analyze Engagement (the number of screenshots or direct messages) on your ads and stories. This will clearly tell you about your performance.
* Check the completion Rate (percentage of users who watched your stories and compare it with the increase in sales to see whether you are performing well or not.

Apart from what has been mentioned above, we have also prepared you with a video about how to develop business on Snapchat. You can watch to facilitate your plan on that platform.
