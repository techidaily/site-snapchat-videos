The first thing that you need to do in order to use the Snapchat voice changer is Launch the Snapchat app. Next, you may hold your finger on the screen, on your face to select the lens and keep holding it until a white colored grid appears and you select the filter from the list available on the right side of the capture button. Or you may also just record the video snap first by holding the capture button without or with any filter selection.

2. Once the recording is over, let the capture button go off to stop the recording. Beside the add to story icon and usual download options, at the left bottom, you can find a speaker icon. For the first time users, check for the message displaying ‘Tap to try Voice Filters!’
