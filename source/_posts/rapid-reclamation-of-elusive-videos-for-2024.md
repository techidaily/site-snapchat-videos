The social media apps keep updating themselves and always keep their users thrilled and engaged with the new updates. People love to take selfies, and how exciting it would be, if the selfie turns into Disney and Pixar-style cartoon characters?

Back in 2020, Snapchat released the lens for Disney. Initially, it was tried on pets by the TikTok users, and people loved it. Later, looking to the response on the Disney lens, Snapchat released another filter as Voila AI Artist. **Send a snap with the cartoon face lens** to get the best response on your click. Also, the Snapchat cartoon face filter is so much famous on Instagram and Facebook.
