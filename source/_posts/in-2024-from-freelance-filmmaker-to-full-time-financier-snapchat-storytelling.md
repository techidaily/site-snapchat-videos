![snapchat app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/snapchat-app.jpg)

In this step-by-step guide, we'll walk you through exactly **how to make money on Snapchat**; so whether you're looking to make a little extra cash on the side or want to start a full-fledged Snapchat marketing career, this article is for you!

## Part 1\. Snapchat Overview

There is a saying goes: _Know the weather, know the terrain, and your victory will be complete._ Before we look into the detailed guidance in [Part 2](#%5FMethods%5FTo%5FMake), we should know more about Snapchat.

Snapchat is a photo messaging app developed on September 16, 2011, by Bobby Murphy,Reggie Brown, and Evan Spiegel while they were studying at Stanford University.

With Snapchat, you can take photos, record videos, add text and drawings, and send them to a controlled list of recipients. These sent MMS are known as "Snaps," and you can set a time limit on how long recipients can view them (a maximum of 24 hours, after which they will be automatically deleted).

Since its inception, Snapchat has evolved to include a wider range of features, including live video chat, story sharing, and lenses (augmented reality filters). Each of these functions is discussed below in detail:

* **Chat:** A messaging functionality you can use to communicate with your friends and family, share snaps, send stickers, or make a video/audio call.
* **Stories:** With this feature, you can add a compilation of images or videos for public viewing - available for 24 hours and then automatically disappear.
* **Live Stories:** There are stories of other users from a specific location or event that disappear after 24 hours.
* **Lenses:** These AR filters can be used to add fun effects to your pictures and post them as your stories or send them to someone.

![snapchat lens](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/snapchat-lens.jpg)

* **Filters:** Unlike lenses, they are static photo [overlays/effects](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that you can apply to your pictures to make them more captivating.
* **Snap Map:** This functionality lets you share your location with your friends. On the map, you will appear as a Bitmoji for them.
* **Snapchat Spotlight:** This is a TikTok-like feature helping many Snapchat users to make money. You can submit your best videos with a chance of earning a share of up to $1 million/day, depending on the number of views.

## Part 2\. Methods To Make Money On Snapchat

Snapchat's focus on short, time-limited content (your snaps/stories stay only for 24 hours) encourages more personalized sharing and contrasts more substantial relationships between brands and customers.

So, how to make money on Snapchat?

### Method 1: Creating Viral Video

When you submit your videos to Spotlight, Snapchat uses an algorithm to personalize the content to its viewers based on their interests by looking at factors such as how many times they watch a video, the number of skips, shares, and likes.

Thus, if your videos get more viewers and become viral, you will start earning money real quick. With that being said, let's understand with a report to see how you can begin making millions with your viral videos on Snapchat.

[Cam Casey](https://biographydaily.com/2022/07/27/cam-casey/), 19 years old TikTok star, decided to post his science experiment involving the explosion of a Coca-Cola bottle on Snapchat. His video went viral on Spotlight, and within two weeks, he became the top performer and earned hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Here is one example video about an experiment of Coke bottle:

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXs0a7BoWxs>

Casey is just one example of how Snapchat's new feature is helping people earn money, and you can be a part of it, too, by following some simple guidelines for posting Snapchat videos. A few of these suggestions are:

* Post up to 60 seconds long videos.
* Add at least one hashtag.
* Make content that is appropriate for a 30+ audience.
* Avoid [forbidden content](https://support.snapchat.com/en-US/a/spotlight-guidelines).
* Do not use sponsored or promotional content.

You might be thinking, "how can you edit your videos to enhance them and make them go viral?"

Well, you can use [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) \- a user-friendly mobile editor that can help you with all your editing tasks on the go. The app has an AR camera, fun filters and effects, cool transition effects, and an impressive exporting feature to help you share your content with multiple social platforms.

### Method 2: Create Snapchat Ads On Your Story Or Ad Revenue Sharing

Snapchat has a more extensive user base and reaches almost 75% of all 13-47 old in the US, making it a great advertising channel.

There are two ways to earn money through ads:

**Get Paid to Advertise On Your Stories**

You can get paid to advertise content on your stories or Spotlight and get paid by the businesses.

For example, a famous content creator on Snapchat, Shaun McBride, collaborated with Disney to advertise the Frozen movie on his stories. However, for this method, you must have a solid follower base to be an [influencer](https://influencermarketinghub.com/what-is-an-influencer/) for any brand out there.

![influencer marketing on snapchat](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/influencer-marketing-on-snapchat.jpg)

**Create Snapchat Ads For Businesses**

Ads are one of the commercial modes of Snapchat. While most business owners are unaware of Snapchat or how to use it to promote their products and services, you can grab this opportunity to earn more.

With creative and interactive ads, you can catch users' attention and advertise other businesses to earn some extra cash in a short time.

Some ads formats offered by Snapchats are:

* Story ads (a series of ads).
* Collection ads (a series of products).
* Filters (artistic overlays).
* Commercials (up to three minutes long).
* Single image or video ads.
* Lenses (interaction with augmented reality).

Besides creating ads, you can also help businesses create AR filters and stickers to attract the masses. For instance, Sephora created an AR game lens to advertise their make-up products, as can be seen in the video:

Similarly, Domino's created a non-skippable ad campaign, "New Bigger Better," in Europe and reached more than 800,000 Norwegian Snapchat users.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Method 3: Promote Your Own Products Or Services To Increase Sales

Aside from promoting other businesses, you can also promote your own products and services on Snapchat. You can share a clickable link or a downloadable asset of your product or service with your followers and friends.

One limitation here is that you must have a larger number of Snapchat friends to generate the desired revenue.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Avoid being too commercial. The audience's feeling is the most important thing to consider here.

### Method 4: Refer Other Products (Affiliate Marketing)

While Snapchat provides influencers with an opportunity to create sponsored content that showcases a brand or product to their followers, you can also use affiliate marketing, in which you receive a commission for promoting someone else's products or services using a link or promo code.

Try to create content that is creative, engaging, and captivating for affiliate marketing. This will definitely help you get user attention and generate more money via your provided links.

### Method 5\. Utilize Geofilter

Geofilters are a fun way to add creative flair to your snaps! These filters can be customized with personalized messages or designs for a specific event, new store openings, or grabbing users' attention and are available only at specific locations.

There are two types of Geofilers:

* **On-demand Geofilters:** These are paid ad filters created by businesses. For instance, Starbucks used a fall-themed geofilter for users near a Starbucks.

![geo filter by starbucks](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/geo-filter-by-starbucks.jpg)

* **Community Geofilters:** These are free-to-create filters that must be approved by Snapchat and can be created for special events or landmarks.

**Note:** Make sure the location is intriguing to users while establishing a Geofilter.

### Method 6: Use Sponsored Lenses

Sponsored lenses are AR filters you can create on Snapchat to promote your business by sharing them with your targeted audience.

When you produce a campaign using sponsored lenses, the platform will guarantee that certain users will use the lens, resulting in huge revenue in return.

For instance, to accelerate their app's user growth, UK's famous Starling bank used an AR lens in 2019 to grab the viewer's attention. As a result, they received a 61% lower cost-per-install than their other campaign.

Similarly, BACARDÍ produced a lens with the summer theme to enhance their brand awareness and drive more sales. In their ten days campaign, they reached over 2.5 M Snapchatters and increased the purchase intent of BACARDÍ products.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Method 7\. Get Featured On The Snapchat Spotlight

Snapchat Spotlight is a new feature highlighting the best content from Snapchat creators. Every day, the platform curates a selection of videos from creators worldwide and puts them in the Spotlight for the viewers.

If you can create awesome content, this will help you expand your exposure instead of generating profits directly. To use the Spotlight, create a snap, add music or voiceover, and click the **"Send >Spotlight"** option.

### Method 8: Use Story Ads

Story Ads let you expand your following base, increase your brand awareness, and get more customers around the globe by displaying ads in the Discovery feed on Snapchat. So, you must put your efforts into creating great story ads for maximum exposure.

For instance, to accelerate their app's user growth, UK's famous Starling bank used an AR lens in 2019 to grab the viewer's attention. As a result, they received a 61% lower cost-per-install than their other campaign.

Similarly, BACARDÍ produced a lens with the summer theme to enhance their brand awareness and drive more sales. In their ten days campaign, they reached over 2.5 M Snapchatters and increased the purchase intent of BACARDÍ products.

### Method 7\. Get Featured On The Snapchat Spotlight

Snapchat Spotlight is a new feature highlighting the best content from Snapchat creators. Every day, the platform curates a selection of videos from creators worldwide and puts them in the Spotlight for the viewers.

If you can create awesome content, this will help you expand your exposure instead of generating profits directly. To use the Spotlight, create a snap, add music or voiceover, and click the **"Send >Spotlight"** option.

* On your phone, open Snapchat.
* Take a picture
* Select the Stickers symbol.
* Select a GIF.
* Choose the GIF you want to use.
* Finally, please include it in the picture.

### 2.How to make your animated GIFs

GIF means Graphics Interchange Format, and it's simply a series of moving, dynamic pictures (think Harry Potter) that loop indefinitely. They give your image, which would otherwise be stagnant and dull, a new dimension.

GIFs are so entertaining that they can be used to carry a whole discussion. However, if you want to learn how to make your GIFs, follow the steps below.

You'll need to utilize the GIPHY application to generate your unique GIFs for this.

On your phone, download the GIPHY app.

1. Start the app on your Mobile and select the create option.
2. **Smile symbol:** Take a Photo and Gallery Option are the three options available to you.
3. Smile Icon: This option allows you to make GIFs using the edit button.
4. **Capture a Photo:** This option allows the user to take a photo on the scene and convert it to a GIF.
5. **Option of Gallery:** You may build a GIF by selecting a photo from your gallery and editing it.
6. Select options and begin designing depending on your preferences.
7. When you will finish, click on the arrow in the bottom right-hand corner to exit.
8. To save all the GIFs, go to Generated GIFs, touch on the three vertical dots, and choose Save GIF.

That GIF has now been saved to your pictures folder and can be seen anytime you need that.

### 3.What is the best way to transmit GIFs on Snapchat?

Putting GIFs in your photos is easy and takes only a few minutes. Here's how to accomplish it.

1. Log in to your Snapchat account by opening the app on your phone.
2. Click a photo or choose an image from your collection to upload.
3. Select the sticker button to add extra components to the Snap.
4. Choose the GIF choice and any GIF you wish.
5. Once you've chosen a GIF, it'll show on the Snap for you to adjust and position anywhere you'd like.
6. Lastly, to send the Snap to your pals, select the arrow option in the lower right corner.
