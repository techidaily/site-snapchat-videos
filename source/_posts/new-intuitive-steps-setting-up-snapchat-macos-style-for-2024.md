## How to Slow Down a Video on Snapchat

Snapchat is an instant messaging app that allows you to share your pictures and videos with your family members, friends, and colleagues. In addition, you can even create your stories in the form of movie clips and share them on the app. These stories remain available for the next 24 hours, after which they are automatically removed from the platform.

While sharing the videos, you can apply [several filters](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that are already present in the app, and Slow Motion is one of them. You may want to learn **how to slow down a video on Snapchat** when you want to emphasize and draw viewers’ attention toward the scene, or wish to make the audience see your actions closely and in detail.

That said, in the following sections, you will see **how to slow down videos on Snapchat**, and what other methods you can use to reduce the playback speed more professionally.

04 [FAQs about Slowing Down Snapchat Video](#part4)

## Part 1: How to Add Slow Motion Effects to Video Using the Snapchat App

Snapchat has a built-in Slow Motion filter that reduces the playback speed of a video when applied. You can learn **how to slow down on Snapchat** by following the instructions that are given below:

**Step 1: Record a Video**

Launch Snapchat on your smartphone (iPhone 13 Pro Max is used here for illustrations), make sure that the **Camera** section is selected from the bottom, tap and hold down the **Capture** button that is present at the lower part of the interface, and let go of it when you are done recording.

![capture videos snapchat](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/capture-videos-snapchat.jpg)

**Step 2: Apply the Slow Motion Filter**

Once the video is recorded, swipe the screen from left to right. Repeat this process until you see the **Snail** (**Slow Motion**) icon on the screen. This will reduce the playback speed of the clip.

![snapchat slow motion effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snapchat-slow-motion-effect.jpg)

**Step 3: Decorate the Video (Optional)**

Use the options present on the upper-right area of the screen to further decorate the video and/or add annotations to it.

## Part 2: How to Record a Slo-Mo Video and Upload to Snapchat

With Snapchat, even though you don’t require any third-party tool to reduce the playback speed of a video, the app has certain limitations. For example, it doesn’t allow you to set a zoom level, you are stuck with the framerate that the app has to offer, etc.

Because of this, many people prefer to use different methods to record a video in slow motion with their preferences, and then upload it to Snapchat. This approach also eliminates the need to swipe the screen several times merely to use a single slow-motion filter.

Fortunately, iPhone has a built-in SLO-MO mode in its Camera app that allows you to capture the videos in slow motion. To learn **how to do slow mo on Snapchat** with the iPhone’s Camera app, you can follow the instructions that are given below:

**Step 1: Get to the iPhone’s SLO-MO Mode**

Launch the **Camera** app on your iPhone (iPhone 13 Pro Max is used here for illustrations), and swipe the screen from left to right until you get to the **SLO-MO** mode.

![iphone slow motion capture mode](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-slow-motion-capture-mode.jpg)

**Step 2: Set Recording Preferences**

Tap the number that is present at the top-right corner (**240** here) to toggle between different framerates, tap **1x** from the lower-center area, swipe slightly up, and then use the wheel that appears next to define your preferred zoom level.

![adjust slow motion zoom level iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adjust-slow-motion-zoom-level-iphone.jpg)

**Step 3: Start and Stop the Recording**

Tap the **Record** button to start the recording, and tap **Stop** when you’re done.

**Note:** Make sure that the duration of the recorded video doesn’t exceed 60 seconds.

**Step 4: Upload the Slow-Motion Video to Snapchat**

After the video is recorded in slow motion, close the **Camera** app, launch Snapchat, and tap the **Gallery** icon from the left side of the **Capture** button on the **Camera** section. From the **Memories** screen, go to the **Camera Roll** tab, and tap to select the video that you recorded in the previous step.

Next, optionally, tap the **Edit** icon from the bottom-left corner to decorate the video and/or add annotations to it, and follow the process as explained in the previous section to share the clip with your family, friends, or colleagues, or publish it as your story.

## Part 3: How to Make Flash and Smooth Slo Mo Video for Snapchat

Although iPhone has the built-in SLO-MO mode that even enables you to set your preferred framerate and zoom level before recording, it still doesn’t allow you to slow down different parts of a video in different speed at your convenience. You can either record the entire video in slow motion or at a normal speed.

This is where a third-party app comes into play. While there are several video editing programs available online, the one of the [best slow motion apps](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that helps you slow down the portions of a video with precision is CapCut.

Downloading and installing CapCut on your iPhone or Android phone is simple, and once it is done, you can follow the process given below to learn **how to slow things down on Snapchat**:

## Part 4: FAQs about Slowing Down Snapchat Video

**1\. Can I record a slow mo video in Snapchat?**

Technically speaking, no, you cannot. However, once you have recorded a video at a normal speed in Snapchat, you can apply the built-in Slow Motion filter to it by swiping the screen from left to right until you see the Snail icon at the center. The Snail icon represents the Slow Motion filter that reduces the playback speed when applied.

**2\. Besides slow-motion, which speed filters does Snapchat have?**

In addition to **slow motion Snapchat** also has Forward and Fast Forward filters that increase the playback speed. While the Forward filter increases the speed slightly, the Fast Forward one enhances it drastically.

**Conclusion**

When using an iPhone, even though the SLO-MO mode enables you to record footage in slow motion, you don’t get many options. Therefore, it would be safe to say that it is easy to slow down the speed of a video if you have a dedicated third-party post-production app. However, if you want to go for a convenient method, learning **how to slow down a video on Snapchat** is an extremely simple and straightforward process.

## Part 2: How to Record a Slo-Mo Video and Upload to Snapchat

With Snapchat, even though you don’t require any third-party tool to reduce the playback speed of a video, the app has certain limitations. For example, it doesn’t allow you to set a zoom level, you are stuck with the framerate that the app has to offer, etc.

Because of this, many people prefer to use different methods to record a video in slow motion with their preferences, and then upload it to Snapchat. This approach also eliminates the need to swipe the screen several times merely to use a single slow-motion filter.

Fortunately, iPhone has a built-in SLO-MO mode in its Camera app that allows you to capture the videos in slow motion. To learn **how to do slow mo on Snapchat** with the iPhone’s Camera app, you can follow the instructions that are given below:

**Step 1: Get to the iPhone’s SLO-MO Mode**

Launch the **Camera** app on your iPhone (iPhone 13 Pro Max is used here for illustrations), and swipe the screen from left to right until you get to the **SLO-MO** mode.
