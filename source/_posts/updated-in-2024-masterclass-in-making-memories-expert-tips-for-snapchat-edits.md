   1. By default, all the file types are marked checked by the software. In order to recover Snapchat photos/videos, you need to click on the file type you wish to recover and then click on next. The non-rooted devices get 2 options- Scan for deleted files and Scan for all files. You can select Scan for all files, though it will take quite long to scan, itâs worth as your phone is checked thoroughly. Click Next.
   2. The Android Data Recovery software analyzes your device and then, scan it to recover the lost data. After the scan process ends, you get a preview of the recoverable files. Just select the files you wish to recover and click on the Recover button to save the files on your PC.

   1. With the end of the scanning process, on the left-hand side of the screen, you can find the App Photos. Click on it and try searching the deleted Snapchat photos and videos. If you find the Snapchats, click on Recover for Snapchat recovery.
   2. If not, then, you may disconnect the iPhone from your PC to try other 2 modes of recovery that are Recover from iTunes backup file and Recover from the iCloud backup file. These two modes to recover Snapchat photos/videos also have trial versions so you can always give it a try.
