You could also send a private snap to that person. If he or she answers the same quickly and yet, you do not get to see their stories that would mean that you are hidden contact in their list.

You could also ask a common friend if they have even received stories and updates from that person. If the person’s stories are reaching others but not you, that means that they have hidden their stories from you.

**Can You Hide Someone on Snapchat Without Them Knowing?**

If you wish to hide someone but in a way that they do not find out, try the new muting function. This allows you to mute certain friends without them realizing the same. The feature is called ‘Do Not Disturb’ and it allows you to mute conversations that are one on one or come from groups. The feature is a new addition and is a useful one. You need not hide or block any contact in this case but simply silence notifications of their updates.

To use this feature, all you need to do is tap on the group or the person you wish to silence. The popup menu would include ‘Settings’ and here you can select the option ‘Do Not Disturb’. You will not receive notifications from such conversations. However, you will still be able to access, check messages from such contacts as well as share your stories as well.

This feature is a useful addition and you need not hide or block a contact to silence conversations from them. Hence, those people will also not get notified unlike when you block a contact. It allows you to see updates from them at your ease and convenience.

## Troubleshooting Tips: When Someone Hide Their Snapchat Stories from You

**How to Know if Someone Hid Their Snapchat Story from You?**

There is a way to find out whether someone is hiding their Snapchat stories from you. You can use someone else’s account to check if their stories are showing on their feed. You could also send a private snap to that person. If he or she answers the same quickly and yet, you do not get to see their stories that would mean that you are hidden contact in their list.

You could also ask a common friend if they have even received stories and updates from that person. If the person’s stories are reaching others but not you, that means that they have hidden their stories from you.

**Can You Hide Someone on Snapchat Without Them Knowing?**

If you wish to hide someone but in a way that they do not find out, try the new muting function. This allows you to mute certain friends without them realizing the same. The feature is called ‘Do Not Disturb’ and it allows you to mute conversations that are one on one or come from groups. The feature is a new addition and is a useful one. You need not hide or block any contact in this case but simply silence notifications of their updates.

To use this feature, all you need to do is tap on the group or the person you wish to silence. The popup menu would include ‘Settings’ and here you can select the option ‘Do Not Disturb’. You will not receive notifications from such conversations. However, you will still be able to access, check messages from such contacts as well as share your stories as well.
