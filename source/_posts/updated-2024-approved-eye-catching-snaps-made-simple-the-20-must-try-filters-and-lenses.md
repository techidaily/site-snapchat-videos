Technology, certainly, has come a long way. In this era of digitalization, one can easily interact with friends on social media. With the emergence of social media, it has now become convenient to maintain social connections and support networks that otherwise wouldn’t have been possible. Social networking platforms have made staying connected with friends, family, and other acquaintances easier than ever.

Snapchat is one such platform that has gained immense popularity over recent years. A multimedia messaging app, it allows you to share pictures and videos with your friends and dear ones. The app lets you take snaps and apply filters and lenses to best express yourself. You can use the **best Snapchat filters** and lenses to add personality and whimsy to snaps.

Whether you want to have some fun with your friends or want to impress someone, Snapchat has amazing effects for every occasion. Indeed, Instagram’s story highlights have become one of the biggest social media platforms. However, by the end of June 2021, Snapchat claimed to have increased its global daily active users to 293 million.

Snapchat’s lenses and filters have become so famous that Instagram has mimicked the feature. But, there’s a reason why snaps are regularly circulating outside Snapchat - the fantastic creative effects give it a leg up over Instagram. Snapchat’s extensive collection of funny lenses, cool filters, and stunning beauty filters makes it way better than Instagram’s.

Wondering how to find good face modifiers from a sea of clones out there? Relax! Our team at Wondershare has done the hard work and made a list of the best filters and lenses on Snapchat. But, first, let’s have a detailed insight into the best Snapchat filters and lenses.

* [Part 2: 20 Best Filters & Lenses On Snapchat to Use in 2021](#part2)
* [Part 3: FAQs About Snapchat Filters & Lenses](#part3)

## Part 1: What Are the Differences Between Snapchat Filters and Lenses?

Snapchat filters are static overlays and sit on the top of your photo or video. In contrast, Snapchat lenses are dynamic, augmented reality animations that alter your voice along with your appearance as you move on the screen. Unlike filters that are added after taking a photo, lenses are displayed while you’re taking the photo.

The best filters on Snapchat let you change a snap’s tint or change the direction or speed in which your video is played back. On the other hand, Snapchat lenses work by utilizing facial recognition software to track your features and apply an animation that follows your facial movements. While lenses can change the sound of your voice and the appearance of your face, filters can only add color tones, messages, customized images, and icons to your snaps.

The photo and video sharing app allow you to make your own filters and lenses. Creating a filter on Snapchat isn’t free as you will have to pay a certain amount based on the filter’s square foot. However, when it comes to making your own Snapchat lens, you won’t have to pay any fees as the entire process is free.

* [Part 3: FAQs About Snapchat Filters & Lenses](#part3)

## Part 1: What Are the Differences Between Snapchat Filters and Lenses?

Snapchat filters are static overlays and sit on the top of your photo or video. In contrast, Snapchat lenses are dynamic, augmented reality animations that alter your voice along with your appearance as you move on the screen. Unlike filters that are added after taking a photo, lenses are displayed while you’re taking the photo.

The best filters on Snapchat let you change a snap’s tint or change the direction or speed in which your video is played back. On the other hand, Snapchat lenses work by utilizing facial recognition software to track your features and apply an animation that follows your facial movements. While lenses can change the sound of your voice and the appearance of your face, filters can only add color tones, messages, customized images, and icons to your snaps.

The photo and video sharing app allow you to make your own filters and lenses. Creating a filter on Snapchat isn’t free as you will have to pay a certain amount based on the filter’s square foot. However, when it comes to making your own Snapchat lens, you won’t have to pay any fees as the entire process is free.

Or your buddies acting weird in their stories? Make use of this freaky funny Snapchat sticker when you smell something fishy.

#### 2.Whaaa eeh??

The perfect snap sticker that relates to our blank situation on a whole new level is this one. People find this sticker quite laughable when used in awkwardly witty cases. Don't get someone's waggish accent but also not wanna feel silly; use this sticker to your benefit.

#### 3.Spill the dirt

Hands down, one of the best Snapchat stickers of all time is this one. See that smile; that smile will tell you all. This quirky Snapchat sticker represents a gossip session you know will be lit before it is even spilled. Through this sticker in your buddy's Snapchat inbox to let them know you're all set to spill the dirt.

#### 4.To meme or not to meme

Mamma-Mia I love this sticker personally. This funny Snapchat sticker was made to represent a poor Shakespeare pun. You can use this sticker in your snaps to cover up after making a joke so terrible; your friends might throw you out of the window.

#### 5.You ma QUEEN

A funny yet adorable Snapchat sticker that represents most love situations perfectly is this one. A single text from your queen and your mind hops on to create romantic scenarios (that are probably never happening). But what can happen is that you can make your honeybunch feel special by sending them this cute snap sticker.

#### 6.It's all good

This ironic Snapchat sticker best represents a situation when you're trying to keep your head above water. Use this sticker on your snap to describe your condition when a social media friend inquires about you.

#### 7.What the behavior dude

Get your Snapchat fam crack up your snap with this super funny Snapchat sticker. For me, it represents a ludicrous situation; most of us end up in daily. Like when you ask for a new shampoo bottle while showering, only to get back the same bottle filled with water.

![Behavior Snapchat Sticker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/behavior-snapchat-sticker.jpg)

#### 8.Your smug smile

The jerry in this Snapchat sticker portrays that one friend in every squad who considers himself the "smart soul." If you're that friend among your team, you will love to use this sticker to show your smug smile every time you put forward your smartness.

![Smug Smile Sticker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/smug-smile-sticker.jpg)

#### 9.No offense, but that was pathetic

That face you make when someone cracks a joke so LAME, you just can't take it. It looks like this Snapchat sticker was created to match our Yikes face. Take advantage of this funny Snapchat sticker and tell someone their joke was pretty pathetic without making them angry.

![Pathetic Snapchat Sticker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pathetic-snapchat-sticker.jpg)

#### 10\. I'm not crying; you're crying

One of the best Snapchat stickers, I believe. It comes from those adorable situations when you're overwhelmed and just can't control your tears (certainly the tears of joy). Imagine your friend sent you a "100 reasons why I love you" text, and it got you awestruck. You won't find a sticker better than this to shower your friend with.
