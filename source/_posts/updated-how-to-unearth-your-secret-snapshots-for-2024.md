As soon as your Android phone is connected to the PC, you can see a screen showing Contacts, Call History, Messaging, Videos, Audio, Gallery, etc.These file types are supported for Snapchat recovery by the Android Data Recovery tool.

![snapchat recover interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snapchat-recover-interface.JPG)

   1. By default, all the file types are marked checked by the software. In order to recover Snapchat photos/videos, you need to click on the file type you wish to recover and then click on next. The non-rooted devices get 2 options- Scan for deleted files and Scan for all files. You can select Scan for all files, though it will take quite long to scan, it’s worth as your phone is checked thoroughly. Click Next.
   2. The Android Data Recovery software analyzes your device and then, scan it to recover the lost data. After the scan process ends, you get a preview of the recoverable files. Just select the files you wish to recover and click on the Recover button to save the files on your PC.
