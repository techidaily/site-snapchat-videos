#### Step 3: Wait for answering

 Their phone will start ringing if they have enabled Snapchat notifications. Enabling notification will also let them know that youâ€™re calling even if they are not using the app that time. Or else, they can only get the call, while using Snapchat.

 There are 3 options to respond to a call.

1. If they click on â€˜Watchâ€™ option, they can see you, but you arenâ€™t allowed for so.
2. If they tap â€˜Joinâ€™ option, it means both of you can see and talk to each other. In case they select â€˜Ignoreâ€™ option, you will get a busy message.
3. If you tap the green camera icon the video becomes one way, where only you can see them, but they wonâ€™t see you.

 Note: By swiping the screen down, you can minimize the Snapchat video call.
