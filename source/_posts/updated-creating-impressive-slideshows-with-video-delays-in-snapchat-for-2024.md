## Creating Impressive Slideshows with Video Delays in Snapchat

Snapchat is an instant messaging app that allows you to share your pictures and videos with your family members, friends, and colleagues. In addition, you can even create your stories in the form of movie clips and share them on the app. These stories remain available for the next 24 hours, after which they are automatically removed from the platform.

While sharing the videos, you can apply [several filters](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that are already present in the app, and Slow Motion is one of them. You may want to learn **how to slow down a video on Snapchat** when you want to emphasize and draw viewers’ attention toward the scene, or wish to make the audience see your actions closely and in detail.

That said, in the following sections, you will see **how to slow down videos on Snapchat**, and what other methods you can use to reduce the playback speed more professionally.

## Part 1: How to Add Slow Motion Effects to Video Using the Snapchat App

Snapchat has a built-in Slow Motion filter that reduces the playback speed of a video when applied. You can learn **how to slow down on Snapchat** by following the instructions that are given below:

**Step 1: Record a Video**

Launch Snapchat on your smartphone (iPhone 13 Pro Max is used here for illustrations), make sure that the **Camera** section is selected from the bottom, tap and hold down the **Capture** button that is present at the lower part of the interface, and let go of it when you are done recording.

![capture videos snapchat](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/capture-videos-snapchat.jpg)

**Step 2: Apply the Slow Motion Filter**

Once the video is recorded, swipe the screen from left to right. Repeat this process until you see the **Snail** (**Slow Motion**) icon on the screen. This will reduce the playback speed of the clip.

![snapchat slow motion effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snapchat-slow-motion-effect.jpg)

**Step 3: Decorate the Video (Optional)**

Use the options present on the upper-right area of the screen to further decorate the video and/or add annotations to it.

## Part 2: How to Record a Slo-Mo Video and Upload to Snapchat

With Snapchat, even though you don’t require any third-party tool to reduce the playback speed of a video, the app has certain limitations. For example, it doesn’t allow you to set a zoom level, you are stuck with the framerate that the app has to offer, etc.

Because of this, many people prefer to use different methods to record a video in slow motion with their preferences, and then upload it to Snapchat. This approach also eliminates the need to swipe the screen several times merely to use a single slow-motion filter.

Fortunately, iPhone has a built-in SLO-MO mode in its Camera app that allows you to capture the videos in slow motion. To learn **how to do slow mo on Snapchat** with the iPhone’s Camera app, you can follow the instructions that are given below:

**Step 1: Get to the iPhone’s SLO-MO Mode**

Launch the **Camera** app on your iPhone (iPhone 13 Pro Max is used here for illustrations), and swipe the screen from left to right until you get to the **SLO-MO** mode.

![iphone slow motion capture mode](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-slow-motion-capture-mode.jpg)

**Step 2: Set Recording Preferences**

Tap the number that is present at the top-right corner (**240** here) to toggle between different framerates, tap **1x** from the lower-center area, swipe slightly up, and then use the wheel that appears next to define your preferred zoom level.

![adjust slow motion zoom level iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adjust-slow-motion-zoom-level-iphone.jpg)

**Step 3: Start and Stop the Recording**

Tap the **Record** button to start the recording, and tap **Stop** when you’re done.

**Note:** Make sure that the duration of the recorded video doesn’t exceed 60 seconds.

**Step 4: Upload the Slow-Motion Video to Snapchat**

After the video is recorded in slow motion, close the **Camera** app, launch Snapchat, and tap the **Gallery** icon from the left side of the **Capture** button on the **Camera** section. From the **Memories** screen, go to the **Camera Roll** tab, and tap to select the video that you recorded in the previous step.

Next, optionally, tap the **Edit** icon from the bottom-left corner to decorate the video and/or add annotations to it, and follow the process as explained in the previous section to share the clip with your family, friends, or colleagues, or publish it as your story.

![upload iphone slow motion video snapchat](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upload-iphone-slow-motion-video-snapchat.jpg)

## Part 3: How to Make Flash and Smooth Slo Mo Video for Snapchat

Although iPhone has the built-in SLO-MO mode that even enables you to set your preferred framerate and zoom level before recording, it still doesn’t allow you to slow down different parts of a video in different speed at your convenience. You can either record the entire video in slow motion or at a normal speed.

This is where a third-party app comes into play. While there are several video editing programs available online, the one of the [best slow motion apps](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that helps you slow down the portions of a video with precision is CapCut.

Downloading and installing CapCut on your iPhone or Android phone is simple, and once it is done, you can follow the process given below to learn **how to slow things down on Snapchat**:

With CapCut, you can either slow down the whole clip or manage the speed for different segments. This section explains both methods.

**Method 1: Slow Down the Whole Clip with CapCut**

**Step 1: Get to the Speed Panel**

Launch CapCut, import the video that you want to slow down, and tap the imported media in the **Timeline**. Next, tap **Speed** from the bottom of the interface to get to the next window.

![capcut speed option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/capcut-speed-option.jpg)

**Step 2: Reduce the Speed of the Video**

Tap **Normal** from the bottom of the screen that appears next, and drag the **Speed** slider to the left to reduce the playback speed. Tap **OK** from the bottom-right corner to save the changes.

![change capcut speed slow motion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-capcut-speed-slow-motion.jpg)

**Step 3: Upload the Video to Snapchat**

Back on the previous interface, optionally tap **Volume** from the bottom and reduce the slider to **0** to [mute the audio](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) of the footage as it may get distorted due to the reduction in the speed.

Next, tap **Share** from the top-right corner to save the video on your iPhone, and then use the method explained in the previous section to access the clip from the **Gallery** within Snapchat for uploading.

**Method 2: Reduce the Playback Speed of Different Parts of a Video**

**Step 1: Get to the Speed Panel**

Use the process described in the previous method to get to the **Speed** panel.

**Step 2: Reduce the Speed of Different Parts of the Video**

Tap **Curve** from the bottom of the interface. On the next screen, tap **Custom** from the lower area, and then tap **Edit**. From the next panel, drag the beat points down to reduce the speed (or drag them above the line to increase).

![capcut curve speed custom edit](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/capcut-curve-speed-custom-edit.jpg)

Notice that each beat point represents a particular section of the video, and dragging it down reduces the playback speed of that segment. You can even tap anywhere on the line to add a new beat point and drag it down as needed for more precise speed management. Once done, tap **OK** from the bottom-right corner to save the modifications.

![adjust speed velocity capcut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adjust-speed-velocity-capcut.jpg)

Optionally, you can also tap any of the available presets on the Curve screen to reduce the playback speed of the video accordingly.

**Step 3: Upload the Video to Snapchat**

Use the method explained in the previous method to export the video, upload it to Snapchat, and share the clip with your family, friends, and colleagues, or publish it as your story.

## Part 4: FAQs about Slowing Down Snapchat Video

**1\. Can I record a slow mo video in Snapchat?**

Technically speaking, no, you cannot. However, once you have recorded a video at a normal speed in Snapchat, you can apply the built-in Slow Motion filter to it by swiping the screen from left to right until you see the Snail icon at the center. The Snail icon represents the Slow Motion filter that reduces the playback speed when applied.

**2\. Besides slow-motion, which speed filters does Snapchat have?**

In addition to **slow motion Snapchat** also has Forward and Fast Forward filters that increase the playback speed. While the Forward filter increases the speed slightly, the Fast Forward one enhances it drastically.

**Conclusion**

When using an iPhone, even though the SLO-MO mode enables you to record footage in slow motion, you don’t get many options. Therefore, it would be safe to say that it is easy to slow down the speed of a video if you have a dedicated third-party post-production app. However, if you want to go for a convenient method, learning **how to slow down a video on Snapchat** is an extremely simple and straightforward process.

With Snapchat, even though you don’t require any third-party tool to reduce the playback speed of a video, the app has certain limitations. For example, it doesn’t allow you to set a zoom level, you are stuck with the framerate that the app has to offer, etc.

Because of this, many people prefer to use different methods to record a video in slow motion with their preferences, and then upload it to Snapchat. This approach also eliminates the need to swipe the screen several times merely to use a single slow-motion filter.

Fortunately, iPhone has a built-in SLO-MO mode in its Camera app that allows you to capture the videos in slow motion. To learn **how to do slow mo on Snapchat** with the iPhone’s Camera app, you can follow the instructions that are given below:

**Step 1: Get to the iPhone’s SLO-MO Mode**

Launch the **Camera** app on your iPhone (iPhone 13 Pro Max is used here for illustrations), and swipe the screen from left to right until you get to the **SLO-MO** mode.

![iphone slow motion capture mode](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-slow-motion-capture-mode.jpg)

**Step 2: Set Recording Preferences**

Tap the number that is present at the top-right corner (**240** here) to toggle between different framerates, tap **1x** from the lower-center area, swipe slightly up, and then use the wheel that appears next to define your preferred zoom level.

![adjust slow motion zoom level iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adjust-slow-motion-zoom-level-iphone.jpg)

**Step 3: Start and Stop the Recording**

Tap the **Record** button to start the recording, and tap **Stop** when you’re done.

**Note:** Make sure that the duration of the recorded video doesn’t exceed 60 seconds.

**Step 4: Upload the Slow-Motion Video to Snapchat**

After the video is recorded in slow motion, close the **Camera** app, launch Snapchat, and tap the **Gallery** icon from the left side of the **Capture** button on the **Camera** section. From the **Memories** screen, go to the **Camera Roll** tab, and tap to select the video that you recorded in the previous step.

Next, optionally, tap the **Edit** icon from the bottom-left corner to decorate the video and/or add annotations to it, and follow the process as explained in the previous section to share the clip with your family, friends, or colleagues, or publish it as your story.

## Part 3: How to Make Flash and Smooth Slo Mo Video for Snapchat

Although iPhone has the built-in SLO-MO mode that even enables you to set your preferred framerate and zoom level before recording, it still doesn’t allow you to slow down different parts of a video in different speed at your convenience. You can either record the entire video in slow motion or at a normal speed.

This is where a third-party app comes into play. While there are several video editing programs available online, the one of the [best slow motion apps](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that helps you slow down the portions of a video with precision is CapCut.

Downloading and installing CapCut on your iPhone or Android phone is simple, and once it is done, you can follow the process given below to learn **how to slow things down on Snapchat**:

With CapCut, you can either slow down the whole clip or manage the speed for different segments. This section explains both methods.

**Method 1: Slow Down the Whole Clip with CapCut**

**Step 1: Get to the Speed Panel**

Launch CapCut, import the video that you want to slow down, and tap the imported media in the **Timeline**. Next, tap **Speed** from the bottom of the interface to get to the next window.

![capcut speed option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/capcut-speed-option.jpg)

**Step 2: Reduce the Speed of the Video**

Tap **Normal** from the bottom of the screen that appears next, and drag the **Speed** slider to the left to reduce the playback speed. Tap **OK** from the bottom-right corner to save the changes.

![change capcut speed slow motion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-capcut-speed-slow-motion.jpg)

**Step 3: Upload the Video to Snapchat**

Back on the previous interface, optionally tap **Volume** from the bottom and reduce the slider to **0** to [mute the audio](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) of the footage as it may get distorted due to the reduction in the speed.

Next, tap **Share** from the top-right corner to save the video on your iPhone, and then use the method explained in the previous section to access the clip from the **Gallery** within Snapchat for uploading.

**Method 2: Reduce the Playback Speed of Different Parts of a Video**

**Step 1: Get to the Speed Panel**

Use the process described in the previous method to get to the **Speed** panel.

**Step 2: Reduce the Speed of Different Parts of the Video**

Tap **Curve** from the bottom of the interface. On the next screen, tap **Custom** from the lower area, and then tap **Edit**. From the next panel, drag the beat points down to reduce the speed (or drag them above the line to increase).

![capcut curve speed custom edit](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/capcut-curve-speed-custom-edit.jpg)

Notice that each beat point represents a particular section of the video, and dragging it down reduces the playback speed of that segment. You can even tap anywhere on the line to add a new beat point and drag it down as needed for more precise speed management. Once done, tap **OK** from the bottom-right corner to save the modifications.

![adjust speed velocity capcut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adjust-speed-velocity-capcut.jpg)

Optionally, you can also tap any of the available presets on the Curve screen to reduce the playback speed of the video accordingly.

**Step 3: Upload the Video to Snapchat**

Use the method explained in the previous method to export the video, upload it to Snapchat, and share the clip with your family, friends, and colleagues, or publish it as your story.

## Part 4: FAQs about Slowing Down Snapchat Video

**1\. Can I record a slow mo video in Snapchat?**

Technically speaking, no, you cannot. However, once you have recorded a video at a normal speed in Snapchat, you can apply the built-in Slow Motion filter to it by swiping the screen from left to right until you see the Snail icon at the center. The Snail icon represents the Slow Motion filter that reduces the playback speed when applied.

**2\. Besides slow-motion, which speed filters does Snapchat have?**

In addition to **slow motion Snapchat** also has Forward and Fast Forward filters that increase the playback speed. While the Forward filter increases the speed slightly, the Fast Forward one enhances it drastically.

**Conclusion**

When using an iPhone, even though the SLO-MO mode enables you to record footage in slow motion, you don’t get many options. Therefore, it would be safe to say that it is easy to slow down the speed of a video if you have a dedicated third-party post-production app. However, if you want to go for a convenient method, learning **how to slow down a video on Snapchat** is an extremely simple and straightforward process.

 The popular social networking app Snapchat comes with some ephemeral features. This self-deleting feature deters users from **saving Snapchat videos** of their friends. Snapchat photos, videos, and stories of contacts vanish from storyboard right after you view them.

 So, what will you do to save photos or videos from your friends’ Snapchat or Snap Stories long before they are gone? You can take a screenshot, save in flight mode, use your computer, or an app to capture the videos and images.

 Through this article, we are going to tell you, how to save Snapchats to your phone to make you watch them later.

* [**Part4: How to save Snapchat videos to your Phone**](#part4)

## Part 1: How to Save Snapchats without them knowing

 You want to save a friend’s Snaps, but Snapchat immediately alerts them of the screen shot taken. Hence, it is not possible to save other’s pictures or videos in Snapchat in incognito mode. You don’t need apps to save Snapchat to your phone. There is hardly a feasible way to do so without the senders’ knowledge. In such a situation, you can try out the following option – saving Snaps in flight mode.

 Here are the steps

1. First of all, launch the Snapchat app on your mobile phone and leave it open. Go to your phone’s ‘Settings’ (Android/iPhone) and toggle on the ‘Airplane/Flight’ mode. Airplane/Flight mode disables all the wireless connections, be it network signals or internet related services for your device (Wi-Fi as well as cellular).

![snapchat save without knowing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snapchat-save-without-knowing.JPG)

2. Browse the Snapchat inbox and view the desired Snap that you wish to save, and quickly take a screenshot. Make sure to be quick enough and do it before the Snap expires.
3. Now, logout from your Snapchat account right after taking the screenshot. You need to follow the logout process according to your device specific settings. Being in ‘Airplane/Flight’ mode you can’t logout, but click the logout option anyway (this is vital!).

![snapchat log out](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snapchat-log-out.JPG)

4. Here, you need to close the Snapchat app on your mobile phone by swiping out the Snapchat app (up/sideways depending on Android/iPhone) from your device’s force quit screen.
5. Toggle off the ‘Airplane/Flight’ mode and wait until your phone connects to the Wi-Fi or mobile network. Now, launch the Snapchat app again and login with the same credentials. The Snaps you have taken screenshots of will still appear as unopened on the storyboard and your friend will have no clue about the Snap being screenshot.

4. Here, you need to close the Snapchat app on your mobile phone by swiping out the Snapchat app (up/sideways depending on Android/iPhone) from your device’s force quit screen.
5. Toggle off the ‘Airplane/Flight’ mode and wait until your phone connects to the Wi-Fi or mobile network. Now, launch the Snapchat app again and login with the same credentials. The Snaps you have taken screenshots of will still appear as unopened on the storyboard and your friend will have no clue about the Snap being screenshot.

## Part 2: How to save Snapchat videos on Mac

 After learning to take screenshots of Snaps using the ‘Airplane’ mode, how about saving Snapchat videos on your Mac computer? Yes, you can easily save Snapchat videos using your iPhone and Mac computer. The process involves recording your iPhone’s screen through your Mac as a movie and then saving it. Here is how to do it

1. Take and connect your iPhone and Mac computer using a lightning cable. Make sure that they are pre-synced. Now, launch QuickTime Player on your computer and then tap ‘File’ in the finder menu, then ‘New Movie Recording’.

2. This will make your Mac’s camera act as the primary camera/recording device. To turn the iPhone as the recording device, go to the QuickTime screen and tap the ‘downward arrow’ button adjacent to the record button. The iPhone will be available under both the Camera and Microphone section, choose it for both the options.

3. You’ll now notice that your iPhone’s screen has been mirrored with your Mac computer.
4. Now, on your iPhone, go to Snapchat and browse the inbox. Subsequently, on your Mac, tap the ‘Record’ button and then start viewing the snaps on your iPhone. QuickTime will record everything from the snaps and save it on your computer.
5. After you’re done with recording, tap the ‘Record’ button again to stop it. Lastly, go to ‘File’ and click ‘Save’, the file format to which the file will be saved is .mov which is generally supported by majority of movie players.

## Part 3: How to save Snapchat videos on Android

 In case you are looking for a way to save Snapchat videos, take screenshots of chats, make slideshows of stories, or record other’s stories on your Android device itself, then AZ Screen recorder is one such app to save those Snapchats. It doesn’t require any root access to your Android phone, so is preferred by most users.

 Step-by-step Tutorial

1. Download the Apk file, install, and launch the AZ Screen Recorder Snapchat App. Set up the account in your Android phone with required information.
2. Tap the ‘Record’ button in AZ Screen Recorder and then open Snapchat inbox. Browse through the content you want to record, the app will record everything on the go.

3. Stop the recording by tapping the ‘Record’ button again.

 Note: When saving Snapchat videos via this method, Snapchat is unable to trace that the video or stories are being recorded. Thereby, you save the Snapchat stories without even notifying the uploader.

## Part 4: How to save Snapchat videos to your Phone

 Here is how

1. Launch Snapchat in your mobile phone and then press and hold the camera button to record a video.
2. Once you are done, lift your finger from the camera and tap the ‘Save’ button from the bottom left corner of the screen.
3. You will see the ‘Saved to memories’ message. Now, browse your Snapchat folder to locate the video.

4. If you forgot to save it before posting as a story, then go to the ‘Stories’ tab and click on the three vertical dots next to ‘My Story’ and select the video. Click the ‘Save’ button next to it to save Snapchat videos to your mobile.

## Conclusion
