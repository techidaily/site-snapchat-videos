Is it always enough simply to leave text messages, share pics and videos? With the innovative features that Snapchat offers, you could do so much more. That is what a private story is all about. If you have had an interesting incident or occurrence, wish to showcase an experience, or tell a little more about yourself, it is best expressed with a private story.
