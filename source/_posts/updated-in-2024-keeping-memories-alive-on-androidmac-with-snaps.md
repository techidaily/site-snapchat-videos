## Part 1: How to Save Snapchats without them knowing

 You want to save a friend’s Snaps, but Snapchat immediately alerts them of the screen shot taken. Hence, it is not possible to save other’s pictures or videos in Snapchat in incognito mode. You don’t need apps to save Snapchat to your phone. There is hardly a feasible way to do so without the senders’ knowledge. In such a situation, you can try out the following option – saving Snaps in flight mode.

 Here are the steps

1. First of all, launch the Snapchat app on your mobile phone and leave it open. Go to your phone’s ‘Settings’ (Android/iPhone) and toggle on the ‘Airplane/Flight’ mode. Airplane/Flight mode disables all the wireless connections, be it network signals or internet related services for your device (Wi-Fi as well as cellular).

2. Browse the Snapchat inbox and view the desired Snap that you wish to save, and quickly take a screenshot. Make sure to be quick enough and do it before the Snap expires.
3. Now, logout from your Snapchat account right after taking the screenshot. You need to follow the logout process according to your device specific settings. Being in ‘Airplane/Flight’ mode you can’t logout, but click the logout option anyway (this is vital!).

4. Here, you need to close the Snapchat app on your mobile phone by swiping out the Snapchat app (up/sideways depending on Android/iPhone) from your device’s force quit screen.
5. Toggle off the ‘Airplane/Flight’ mode and wait until your phone connects to the Wi-Fi or mobile network. Now, launch the Snapchat app again and login with the same credentials. The Snaps you have taken screenshots of will still appear as unopened on the storyboard and your friend will have no clue about the Snap being screenshot.

## Part 2: How to save Snapchat videos on Mac

 After learning to take screenshots of Snaps using the ‘Airplane’ mode, how about saving Snapchat videos on your Mac computer? Yes, you can easily save Snapchat videos using your iPhone and Mac computer. The process involves recording your iPhone’s screen through your Mac as a movie and then saving it. Here is how to do it

1. Take and connect your iPhone and Mac computer using a lightning cable. Make sure that they are pre-synced. Now, launch QuickTime Player on your computer and then tap ‘File’ in the finder menu, then ‘New Movie Recording’.

![snapchat quicktime](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snapchat-quiktime.JPG)

2. This will make your Mac’s camera act as the primary camera/recording device. To turn the iPhone as the recording device, go to the QuickTime screen and tap the ‘downward arrow’ button adjacent to the record button. The iPhone will be available under both the Camera and Microphone section, choose it for both the options.

![snapchat record](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snapchat-record.JPG)

3. You’ll now notice that your iPhone’s screen has been mirrored with your Mac computer.
4. Now, on your iPhone, go to Snapchat and browse the inbox. Subsequently, on your Mac, tap the ‘Record’ button and then start viewing the snaps on your iPhone. QuickTime will record everything from the snaps and save it on your computer.
5. After you’re done with recording, tap the ‘Record’ button again to stop it. Lastly, go to ‘File’ and click ‘Save’, the file format to which the file will be saved is .mov which is generally supported by majority of movie players.

 The popular social networking app Snapchat comes with some ephemeral features. This self-deleting feature deters users from **saving Snapchat videos** of their friends. Snapchat photos, videos, and stories of contacts vanish from storyboard right after you view them.

 So, what will you do to save photos or videos from your friends’ Snapchat or Snap Stories long before they are gone? You can take a screenshot, save in flight mode, use your computer, or an app to capture the videos and images.

 Through this article, we are going to tell you, how to save Snapchats to your phone to make you watch them later.

* [**Part2: How to save Snapchat videos on Mac**](#part2)
* [**Part3: How to save Snapchat videos on Android**](#part3)
* [**Part4: How to save Snapchat videos to your Phone**](#part4)

## Part 1: How to Save Snapchats without them knowing

 You want to save a friend’s Snaps, but Snapchat immediately alerts them of the screen shot taken. Hence, it is not possible to save other’s pictures or videos in Snapchat in incognito mode. You don’t need apps to save Snapchat to your phone. There is hardly a feasible way to do so without the senders’ knowledge. In such a situation, you can try out the following option – saving Snaps in flight mode.

 Here are the steps

1. First of all, launch the Snapchat app on your mobile phone and leave it open. Go to your phone’s ‘Settings’ (Android/iPhone) and toggle on the ‘Airplane/Flight’ mode. Airplane/Flight mode disables all the wireless connections, be it network signals or internet related services for your device (Wi-Fi as well as cellular).

![snapchat save without knowing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snapchat-save-without-knowing.JPG)

2. Browse the Snapchat inbox and view the desired Snap that you wish to save, and quickly take a screenshot. Make sure to be quick enough and do it before the Snap expires.
3. Now, logout from your Snapchat account right after taking the screenshot. You need to follow the logout process according to your device specific settings. Being in ‘Airplane/Flight’ mode you can’t logout, but click the logout option anyway (this is vital!).

![snapchat log out](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snapchat-log-out.JPG)

4. Here, you need to close the Snapchat app on your mobile phone by swiping out the Snapchat app (up/sideways depending on Android/iPhone) from your device’s force quit screen.
5. Toggle off the ‘Airplane/Flight’ mode and wait until your phone connects to the Wi-Fi or mobile network. Now, launch the Snapchat app again and login with the same credentials. The Snaps you have taken screenshots of will still appear as unopened on the storyboard and your friend will have no clue about the Snap being screenshot.

## Part 2: How to save Snapchat videos on Mac

 After learning to take screenshots of Snaps using the ‘Airplane’ mode, how about saving Snapchat videos on your Mac computer? Yes, you can easily save Snapchat videos using your iPhone and Mac computer. The process involves recording your iPhone’s screen through your Mac as a movie and then saving it. Here is how to do it

1. Take and connect your iPhone and Mac computer using a lightning cable. Make sure that they are pre-synced. Now, launch QuickTime Player on your computer and then tap ‘File’ in the finder menu, then ‘New Movie Recording’.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![snapchat quicktime](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snapchat-quiktime.JPG)

2. This will make your Mac’s camera act as the primary camera/recording device. To turn the iPhone as the recording device, go to the QuickTime screen and tap the ‘downward arrow’ button adjacent to the record button. The iPhone will be available under both the Camera and Microphone section, choose it for both the options.

![snapchat record](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snapchat-record.JPG)

3. You’ll now notice that your iPhone’s screen has been mirrored with your Mac computer.
4. Now, on your iPhone, go to Snapchat and browse the inbox. Subsequently, on your Mac, tap the ‘Record’ button and then start viewing the snaps on your iPhone. QuickTime will record everything from the snaps and save it on your computer.
5. After you’re done with recording, tap the ‘Record’ button again to stop it. Lastly, go to ‘File’ and click ‘Save’, the file format to which the file will be saved is .mov which is generally supported by majority of movie players.

## Part 3: How to save Snapchat videos on Android

 In case you are looking for a way to save Snapchat videos, take screenshots of chats, make slideshows of stories, or record other’s stories on your Android device itself, then AZ Screen recorder is one such app to save those Snapchats. It doesn’t require any root access to your Android phone, so is preferred by most users.

 Step-by-step Tutorial

1. Download the Apk file, install, and launch the AZ Screen Recorder Snapchat App. Set up the account in your Android phone with required information.
2. Tap the ‘Record’ button in AZ Screen Recorder and then open Snapchat inbox. Browse through the content you want to record, the app will record everything on the go.

![snapchat az screen recorder](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snapchat-az-screen-recorder.JPG)

3. Stop the recording by tapping the ‘Record’ button again.

 Note: When saving Snapchat videos via this method, Snapchat is unable to trace that the video or stories are being recorded. Thereby, you save the Snapchat stories without even notifying the uploader.

## Part 4: How to save Snapchat videos to your Phone

 If you are wondering about saving your own Snapchat videos to your phone, then you are at the right place for a solution. It’s pretty simple, just like saving a photo.

 Here is how

1. Launch Snapchat in your mobile phone and then press and hold the camera button to record a video.
2. Once you are done, lift your finger from the camera and tap the ‘Save’ button from the bottom left corner of the screen.
3. You will see the ‘Saved to memories’ message. Now, browse your Snapchat folder to locate the video.

![snapchat save memory](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snapchat-save-memory.JPG)

4. If you forgot to save it before posting as a story, then go to the ‘Stories’ tab and click on the three vertical dots next to ‘My Story’ and select the video. Click the ‘Save’ button next to it to save Snapchat videos to your mobile.

## Conclusion

 It is not impossible to save Snapchat videos to your Mac or Android phone. In fact, you just need to learn the right way that suits you. Be it through the apps to save Snapchat videos and stories or taking screenshots in ‘Airplane’ mode, you got to be quick and save what you like.

## Part 1: How to video chat/call on Snapchat

 Least people had an idea that Snapchat offers a sleek video calling feature as well. So, we are bringing you the steps as how to video call someone using Snapchat without any trouble. Let’s see how you can enjoy communicating face to face from your respective places–

#### Step 1: Swipe right to start a video chat

 First of all, launch the latest version of Snapchat on your mobile and then swipe right on the camera to get the ‘Friends’ list. You can also tap on the ‘Friends’ tab found at the bottom left corner of the screen. Now, find the contact you want to make a Snapchat video call with, and tap or right swipe on it.

![snapchat call](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snapchat-call.JPG)

#### Step 2: Press video camera icon

 In this step, you will start calling your friend. For this, look for the video recorder icon on the next screen and tap on it to place the call. It should start ringing ASAP by sending them a chat request.

![snapchat press](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snapchat-press.JPG)

#### Step 3: Wait for answering

 Their phone will start ringing if they have enabled Snapchat notifications. Enabling notification will also let them know that you’re calling even if they are not using the app that time. Or else, they can only get the call, while using Snapchat.

![snapchat wait call](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snapchat-wait-call.JPG)

 There are 3 options to respond to a call.

1. If they click on ‘Watch’ option, they can see you, but you aren’t allowed for so.
2. If they tap ‘Join’ option, it means both of you can see and talk to each other. In case they select ‘Ignore’ option, you will get a busy message.
3. If you tap the green camera icon the video becomes one way, where only you can see them, but they won’t see you.

 Note: By swiping the screen down, you can minimize the Snapchat video call.
