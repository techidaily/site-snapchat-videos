Technology, certainly, has come a long way. In this era of digitalization, one can easily interact with friends on social media. With the emergence of social media, it has now become convenient to maintain social connections and support networks that otherwise wouldn’t have been possible. Social networking platforms have made staying connected with friends, family, and other acquaintances easier than ever.

Snapchat is one such platform that has gained immense popularity over recent years. A multimedia messaging app, it allows you to share pictures and videos with your friends and dear ones. The app lets you take snaps and apply filters and lenses to best express yourself. You can use the **best Snapchat filters** and lenses to add personality and whimsy to snaps.

Whether you want to have some fun with your friends or want to impress someone, Snapchat has amazing effects for every occasion. Indeed, Instagram’s story highlights have become one of the biggest social media platforms. However, by the end of June 2021, Snapchat claimed to have increased its global daily active users to 293 million.

Snapchat’s lenses and filters have become so famous that Instagram has mimicked the feature. But, there’s a reason why snaps are regularly circulating outside Snapchat - the fantastic creative effects give it a leg up over Instagram. Snapchat’s extensive collection of funny lenses, cool filters, and stunning beauty filters makes it way better than Instagram’s.

Wondering how to find good face modifiers from a sea of clones out there? Relax! Our team at Wondershare has done the hard work and made a list of the best filters and lenses on Snapchat. But, first, let’s have a detailed insight into the best Snapchat filters and lenses.

* [Part 2: 20 Best Filters & Lenses On Snapchat to Use in 2021](#part2)
* [Part 3: FAQs About Snapchat Filters & Lenses](#part3)

## Part 1: What Are the Differences Between Snapchat Filters and Lenses?

Snapchat filters are static overlays and sit on the top of your photo or video. In contrast, Snapchat lenses are dynamic, augmented reality animations that alter your voice along with your appearance as you move on the screen. Unlike filters that are added after taking a photo, lenses are displayed while you’re taking the photo.

The best filters on Snapchat let you change a snap’s tint or change the direction or speed in which your video is played back. On the other hand, Snapchat lenses work by utilizing facial recognition software to track your features and apply an animation that follows your facial movements. While lenses can change the sound of your voice and the appearance of your face, filters can only add color tones, messages, customized images, and icons to your snaps.

The photo and video sharing app allow you to make your own filters and lenses. Creating a filter on Snapchat isn’t free as you will have to pay a certain amount based on the filter’s square foot. However, when it comes to making your own Snapchat lens, you won’t have to pay any fees as the entire process is free.

Snapchat filters are static overlays and sit on the top of your photo or video. In contrast, Snapchat lenses are dynamic, augmented reality animations that alter your voice along with your appearance as you move on the screen. Unlike filters that are added after taking a photo, lenses are displayed while you’re taking the photo.

The best filters on Snapchat let you change a snap’s tint or change the direction or speed in which your video is played back. On the other hand, Snapchat lenses work by utilizing facial recognition software to track your features and apply an animation that follows your facial movements. While lenses can change the sound of your voice and the appearance of your face, filters can only add color tones, messages, customized images, and icons to your snaps.

The photo and video sharing app allow you to make your own filters and lenses. Creating a filter on Snapchat isn’t free as you will have to pay a certain amount based on the filter’s square foot. However, when it comes to making your own Snapchat lens, you won’t have to pay any fees as the entire process is free.

But the million-dollar question is – what’s the difference between the two marketing channels from the perspective of an influencer and a marketer? The article here draws out the dissimilarities between the two for the brands to identify the most fitting potential marketing channel to promote themselves.

Regarding its target audience, they are mostly the millennials, 218 million of whom fall into the list of active users. From a marketing perspective, it permits brands to promote themselves through shoppable ads, branded filters, personalized targeting, AR lenses, and Snap Ad.

Wondering what’s an Influencer? Well, it’s someone you hire to promote your organization’s products when you fail to reach out to a wider audience. The person entrusted with the responsibilities of marketing your brand will ensure the flooding in of more followers for greater exposure. It’s a concept similar to social media influencers that you would find in both TikTok and Snapchat.

From the stance of an Influencer, here are 5 differences between the two apps.

* **Core Features**

Influencers tend to look for features for creating a gripping visual content. TikTok ushers a quite a few of them, including video capture, filter effects, sound library, impressive editing tools, creation prompts and a ‘For You’ page, where the discovery feed based on algorithm is available.

On the contrary, Snapchat features similar such tools but with the only difference being in the count. You will find here more options besides video capture and editing tools, these being text and video chat, AR Lenses, Story creation, Discover tab, image capture, and Snap Maps.

* **Type of Users**

While in TikTok, you will mostly find the celebrities, renowned brands and content creators to flood the social media platform; in Snapchat, the crowd mostly comprises of publishers.

* **Demographic**

Mostly Gen-Z occupies the crowd in TikTok, majority of whom belong to the age group 18-24\. However, Snapchat is mostly dominated by millennials.

* **Active Users**

The relatively new app of TikTok happens to attract fewer active users, accounting 41 million globally, whereas Snapchat enjoys the presence of 218 million population daily.

* **Downloads**

Probably because TikTok is new to people that 738 million of them have downloaded the app from all around the world in the year 2019 itself. However, Snapchat recorded 75 million globally in the same year.

An influencer observes all the above statistics before choosing to go for the preferred social media network.

## TikTok vs. Snapchat: What Marketers Should Know

Sometimes, marketers seem to put all their energy into an app without realizing the level of effectiveness it would generate. The same holds for TikTok and Snapchat. So, it’s always wise to walk through the pros and cons of both, seek out the contrasting points from the perspective of certain key indicators and then decide. If you are here wondering where to start your advertising campaign from, go through the points below to make an informed decision.

* **Content Marketing**

Go for the TikTok app, if you are targeting the Gen-Z population and currently undergoing budget constraints. With inclusions of hashtags and keywords, you can optimize the video content, attract your target audience, and build a community around you. However, it’s not a very promising app for directing traffic to your website as the social media network allows only a few brands to share the link of their created videos in the website content.

On the contrary, Snapchat is the most favorable app among brands seeking a platform to launch short, bite-sized videos to promote a newly-launched product and gain admiration from both Gen-Z and millennials. And the best thing? You can always draw online traffic to your website through them and generate greater conversions.

* **Marketing Opportunities**

Lucrative opportunities await the small businesses investing their time and energy in TikTok because the platform being relatively new, sets limited norms on what makes content engaging and what fails to achieve it. Moreover, it’s a great spot to test the waters before going widespread with your products over other social media networks.

Snapchat, on the contrary, is most suitable for mid-sized and large-scale companies because it lacks the perspective of free content creation. However, plenty of advertising alternatives are floating up for brands to leverage, which is why most of the companies are now investing more in it than other advertising channels. Moreover, it enables all business users to share links of created content on websites that TikTok fails to cover.

Put simply, Snapchat promises more marketing opportunities to businesses that have ample funds whereas TikTok favors those who are pressed for money. But, speaking of brand-friendliness, the latter welcomes more experiments than prior.

* **User Base & Behavior**

Prior to launching a promotional campaign, don’t you think it’s prudent to grab an idea about the user base in each app? Of course, otherwise, you will be landing with the wrong audience and gradually fail to generate enough conversions.

Believe it or not, but reports claim that Snapchat is home to 210 million active users daily, whereas TikTok to 800 million every month. Though both the apps attract millennials and Gen-Z users, launching your ad campaign in the prior will mean more exposure of your products to a vast audience, 61% of whom are female. However, if you are focusing more on men, TikTok will a great platform to start with because 56% of the global male audience is its active users.

**What to Choose?**

Thankfully, we now have an answer to the most sought-after debate of TikTok vs. Snapchat! If you are seeking a platform that’s more stable and widely used up by the general population, Snapchat should be your go-to app. In the past, it has offered better ROI (Return on Investment) to brands choosing to reach out to their target audience through it. And, with ad offerings on the rise here, it’s certainly more approachable to brands. But, let’s not disregard TikTok because it’s in the nascent stage. Let’s not forget that it’s a great platform to run experiments and observe the reactions of Gen-Z before reaching out to millennials. The ball is in your court now. Go for whatever seems to be the most fitting for your business and look beyond the traditional social media networks for a change to stay afloat in the market.

Prior to launching a promotional campaign, don’t you think it’s prudent to grab an idea about the user base in each app? Of course, otherwise, you will be landing with the wrong audience and gradually fail to generate enough conversions.

Believe it or not, but reports claim that Snapchat is home to 210 million active users daily, whereas TikTok to 800 million every month. Though both the apps attract millennials and Gen-Z users, launching your ad campaign in the prior will mean more exposure of your products to a vast audience, 61% of whom are female. However, if you are focusing more on men, TikTok will a great platform to start with because 56% of the global male audience is its active users.

**What to Choose?**

Thankfully, we now have an answer to the most sought-after debate of TikTok vs. Snapchat! If you are seeking a platform that’s more stable and widely used up by the general population, Snapchat should be your go-to app. In the past, it has offered better ROI (Return on Investment) to brands choosing to reach out to their target audience through it. And, with ad offerings on the rise here, it’s certainly more approachable to brands. But, let’s not disregard TikTok because it’s in the nascent stage. Let’s not forget that it’s a great platform to run experiments and observe the reactions of Gen-Z before reaching out to millennials. The ball is in your court now. Go for whatever seems to be the most fitting for your business and look beyond the traditional social media networks for a change to stay afloat in the market.
