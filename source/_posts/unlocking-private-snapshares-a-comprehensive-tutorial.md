There is a way to find out whether someone is hiding their Snapchat stories from you. You can use someone else’s account to check if their stories are showing on their feed. You could also send a private snap to that person. If he or she answers the same quickly and yet, you do not get to see their stories that would mean that you are hidden contact in their list.

You could also ask a common friend if they have even received stories and updates from that person. If the person’s stories are reaching others but not you, that means that they have hidden their stories from you.

**Can You Hide Someone on Snapchat Without Them Knowing?**

If you wish to hide someone but in a way that they do not find out, try the new muting function. This allows you to mute certain friends without them realizing the same. The feature is called ‘Do Not Disturb’ and it allows you to mute conversations that are one on one or come from groups. The feature is a new addition and is a useful one. You need not hide or block any contact in this case but simply silence notifications of their updates.

To use this feature, all you need to do is tap on the group or the person you wish to silence. The popup menu would include ‘Settings’ and here you can select the option ‘Do Not Disturb’. You will not receive notifications from such conversations. However, you will still be able to access, check messages from such contacts as well as share your stories as well.

This feature is a useful addition and you need not hide or block a contact to silence conversations from them. Hence, those people will also not get notified unlike when you block a contact. It allows you to see updates from them at your ease and convenience.

### Conclusion

Snapchat is an attractive platform to get your daily moments the attention they deserve. You can create stories, private or with anyone else, and share them with selective people of your choice. The Snapchat private story option is great to keep your moments between your close friends or loved ones. Other features such as ‘Do Not Disturb’ allow you to silence notifications from friends or groups that you wish to check as per your convenience.

* [Part 4: Troubleshooting Tips: When Someone Hide Their Snapchat Stories from You](#part4)

## What Is a Private Story on Snapchat?

Stories are a term popular in Snapchat, to showcase images and videos for the last 24 hours. Stories can comprise photos as well as videos. You can post stories to your feed which you can view as well as your friends. These show your friends your different activities the day before. These exist for the next 24 hours within which you can replay them many times.

There is a difference between ‘My Stories’ and ‘Private Stories’. When you record and post a video or a photo on your Snapchat account publicly, it is seen by all your contacts. On the other hand, if you wish to post a private story, you need to create a custom story. After you create a custom story, you can then post the same as a private one. Here you select the ones who would view the story. You choose the contacts who would view the post before publishing it. Another aspect is that no one else can add content to the private stories you post on Snapchat.

## Troubleshooting Tips: When Someone Hide Their Snapchat Stories from You

**How to Know if Someone Hid Their Snapchat Story from You?**

There is a way to find out whether someone is hiding their Snapchat stories from you. You can use someone else’s account to check if their stories are showing on their feed. You could also send a private snap to that person. If he or she answers the same quickly and yet, you do not get to see their stories that would mean that you are hidden contact in their list.

You could also ask a common friend if they have even received stories and updates from that person. If the person’s stories are reaching others but not you, that means that they have hidden their stories from you.

**Can You Hide Someone on Snapchat Without Them Knowing?**

If you wish to hide someone but in a way that they do not find out, try the new muting function. This allows you to mute certain friends without them realizing the same. The feature is called ‘Do Not Disturb’ and it allows you to mute conversations that are one on one or come from groups. The feature is a new addition and is a useful one. You need not hide or block any contact in this case but simply silence notifications of their updates.

To use this feature, all you need to do is tap on the group or the person you wish to silence. The popup menu would include ‘Settings’ and here you can select the option ‘Do Not Disturb’. You will not receive notifications from such conversations. However, you will still be able to access, check messages from such contacts as well as share your stories as well.

This feature is a useful addition and you need not hide or block a contact to silence conversations from them. Hence, those people will also not get notified unlike when you block a contact. It allows you to see updates from them at your ease and convenience.

### Conclusion

Snapchat is an attractive platform to get your daily moments the attention they deserve. You can create stories, private or with anyone else, and share them with selective people of your choice. The Snapchat private story option is great to keep your moments between your close friends or loved ones. Other features such as ‘Do Not Disturb’ allow you to silence notifications from friends or groups that you wish to check as per your convenience.
