Lens Studio is perfect for businesses that may want to create unique environments for their clients, or the times when they are releasing company Snapchat posts. Say the company is hosting an event. They may want a custom graphic for that event, which is used for all the pictures and videos posted to Snapchat about the event. Using Lens Studio lets them do that with ease.

Create Your Own Lens is great when you are going to a special event, birthday party or graduating, and you want a special graphic that comes up in all your snaps. It is very intuitive to use, and is available through the App Store as a download.

## Part 2: How to Use Lens Studio

#### 1\. Download Lens Studio

The first step involves downloading Lens Studio, which you can do from your computer. It is compatible with both Windows and Mac computers, and will run on any semi-modern system. According to the Snapchat team, Lens Studio is similar to the program used by their AR teams to create lenses. That means you are getting similar functionality, but with an easier to manage interface.

#### 2\. Choose Templates Page

It is normal to feel a little overwhelmed the first time you try and use this program. But that is why the templates page is so great. You can select from templates depending on the type of lens that you are hoping to create. You can just use a template, or you can incorporate your own ideas to customize the template.

There is also a Lens Studio Overview guide that you can access online, which will help you get acquainted with the program’s various features and quirks.

#### 3\. Use Studio Panels

Are you ready to create your own custom Snapchat lens? It is time to head over to Studio Panels on the application. This is the area where you can add your own 2D or 3D objects, and you can visualize how they would look as a Snapchat filter. You can add, remove, resize and drag objects to specific areas of the screen.

There are other tools accessible from the Resources panel. You can use these tools to ensure that your Snapchat lens is exactly as you want.

![lens studio panel](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lens-studio-panal.JPG)

#### 4\. Preview the Snapchat Lens You Create

The great thing about this application is that you can preview the lens before you send it out to your phone. When you are satisfied with the image on the preview, you can pair your phone with the application, and you will be able to send that Snapchat lens onto your phone through your Snapcode. It is that simple!

## Part 3: How to Create Snapchat Lenses Using Create Your Own Lens

1. There are two ways that you can access the tool for creating fun Snapchat lenses. You can either visit the website snapchat.com/create, or you can go on the “filters and lenses” section on your iOS device. If you are using Snapchat on an Android device, you will only have the option for the website. But the feature is coming to the Android version of Snapchat very soon.
2. When you are in the application or on the website, you may start to look at the different templates for Snapchat lenses. Now you can add other items into the templates, such as photographs, text or graphics.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![create snapchat](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-snapchat.JPG)

It is all up to your imagination. You can create the perfect Snapchat lens, which you can then send into your Snapchat account through your Snapcode. Of course, if you are using your iOS device to create the lens, it is already linked to your account.

Another cool feature is how you can set the location for where the Snapchat lens is available. Say you are hosting a party. You can have the Snapchat lens available to everyone who uses Snapchat within a set square footage of your home. That is an amazing way to let everyone share social media pictures and photos of your party, through the lens you created.

## Conclusion

Creating Snapchat lenses has never been easier. Whether you are a business looking to add a custom lens, or you just want to create a fun lens for a graduation or party, there are tools that make the job very easy. Using these tools will allow you to create the perfect Snapchat lens for any occasion.

## Part 1: Comparing Lens Studio and Creating Your Own Lens

The two programs that we are highlighting today are Lens Studio and Create Your Own Lens. These are both fantastic programs for creating your own Snapchat lens, but they do have slightly different uses. If you are the type of person who wants to design a professional Snapchat lens, you are going to prefer Lens Studio.

The beauty of Snapchat lenses is that you can now create your own environment, which you can use each time you are taking photos or videos. Sure, you can always use the filters that are already available in the application, but not everyone would find those enough.

## Part 3: How to Create Snapchat Lenses Using Create Your Own Lens

1. There are two ways that you can access the tool for creating fun Snapchat lenses. You can either visit the website snapchat.com/create, or you can go on the “filters and lenses” section on your iOS device. If you are using Snapchat on an Android device, you will only have the option for the website. But the feature is coming to the Android version of Snapchat very soon.
2. When you are in the application or on the website, you may start to look at the different templates for Snapchat lenses. Now you can add other items into the templates, such as photographs, text or graphics.

It is all up to your imagination. You can create the perfect Snapchat lens, which you can then send into your Snapchat account through your Snapcode. Of course, if you are using your iOS device to create the lens, it is already linked to your account.

Another cool feature is how you can set the location for where the Snapchat lens is available. Say you are hosting a party. You can have the Snapchat lens available to everyone who uses Snapchat within a set square footage of your home. That is an amazing way to let everyone share social media pictures and photos of your party, through the lens you created.
