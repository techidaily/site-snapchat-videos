Using the GIPHY keypad on your iPhone, you can share GIFs straight to your pals via Snapchat chats. However, you must first activate the keypad.

1. Turn on the GIPHY keypad on your iPhone. Install the GIPHY phone app from the Apple Store. After you've downloaded the app, you'll need to activate the GIPHY keypad on your iPhone.
2. To do just that, go over to the iPhone configuration menu and select “General” from the drop-down menu.
