Step1 On your selected picture, tap the **Pencil** icon to open the drawing tool. Drag your finger on the **Color meter** to select the color.

Step2 Tap the **Color wheel** to change the color palette and then choose the color you want. To draw emojis on your picture, tap the Emoji icon and select the one you want to use.

Step2 Search for the theme using the **Search box** or scroll up and down to find the one you like.
