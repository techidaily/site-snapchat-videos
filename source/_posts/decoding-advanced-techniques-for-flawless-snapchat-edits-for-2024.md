If you are unable to recover Snapchat photos/videos from the specific folder on your Android phone, you also can use Snapchat recovery to retrieve them on Android phone. The steps to retrieving the deleted content are-

   1. Firstly, connect your Android phone to the Android Data Recovery app by downloading, installing, and launching it on your PC. Once done, go to the Recover option. Next, use a USB cable for connecting the Android phone to your PC. Always ensure USB debugging is enabled on the phone.

![snapchat recover](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/recover-snapchat-android.JPG)

   1. You receive a pop-up when your Android phone’s operating software is 4.2.2 or higher version, you just need to tap the OK button to allow the USB debugging on your Andoird phone. As soon as your Android phone is connected to the PC, you can see a screen showing Contacts, Call History, Messaging, Videos, Audio, Gallery, etc.These file types are supported for Snapchat recovery by the Android Data Recovery tool.

The non-rooted devices get 2 options- Scan for deleted files and Scan for all files. You can select Scan for all files, though it will take quite long to scan, it’s worth as your phone is checked thoroughly. Click Next.
   2. The Android Data Recovery software analyzes your device and then, scan it to recover the lost data. After the scan process ends, you get a preview of the recoverable files. Just select the files you wish to recover and click on the Recover button to save the files on your PC.
