### 2.How to make your animated GIFs

GIF means Graphics Interchange Format, and it's simply a series of moving, dynamic pictures (think Harry Potter) that loop indefinitely. They give your image, which would otherwise be stagnant and dull, a new dimension.

GIFs are so entertaining that they can be used to carry a whole discussion. However, if you want to learn how to make your GIFs, follow the steps below.

You'll need to utilize the GIPHY application to generate your unique GIFs for this.

On your phone, download the GIPHY app.

1. Start the app on your Mobile and select the create option.
2. **Smile symbol:** Take a Photo and Gallery Option are the three options available to you.
3. Smile Icon: This option allows you to make GIFs using the edit button.
4. **Capture a Photo:** This option allows the user to take a photo on the scene and convert it to a GIF.
5. **Option of Gallery:** You may build a GIF by selecting a photo from your gallery and editing it.
6. Select options and begin designing depending on your preferences.
7. When you will finish, click on the arrow in the bottom right-hand corner to exit.
8. To save all the GIFs, go to Generated GIFs, touch on the three vertical dots, and choose Save GIF.

That GIF has now been saved to your pictures folder and can be seen anytime you need that.

### 3.What is the best way to transmit GIFs on Snapchat?

Putting GIFs in your photos is easy and takes only a few minutes. Here's how to accomplish it.

1. Log in to your Snapchat account by opening the app on your phone.
2. Click a photo or choose an image from your collection to upload.
3. Select the sticker button to add extra components to the Snap.
4. Choose the GIF choice and any GIF you wish.
5. Once you've chosen a GIF, it'll show on the Snap for you to adjust and position anywhere you'd like.
6. Lastly, to send the Snap to your pals, select the arrow option in the lower right corner.
