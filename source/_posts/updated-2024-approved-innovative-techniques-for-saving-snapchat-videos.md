### Method 1: Regular Loop

On Snapchat, a Regular Loop feature allows you to play your snap without back-and-forth effect. By applying this feature, you can make your video enjoyable without the Bounce option. To use this feature, capture a video from the recording button and then press the "Infinity" icon twice. By tapping on the Infinity icon twice, you can activate the feature "Loop."

### Method 2: Limitless Snap

Apart from using the Regular Loop feature, you can use another exciting feature called "Limitless Snap." This feature lets you send snaps to your friends and post the stories in an endless loop. The limitless snap will play continuously until your added friend does not close it on his own. To utilize this feature, press the "Infinity" icon and select the timer from 1 to infinity to play the snaps on loop.
