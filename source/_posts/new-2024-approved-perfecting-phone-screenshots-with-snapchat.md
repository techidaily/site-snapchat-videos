## Part 3: How to Check Your Backup Progress

To ensure a complete backup of your Memories on Snapchat, a stable Wi-Fi connection is mandatory. That's why make sure to connect your phone with a stable and strong internet connection. Moreover, if you have chosen multiple photos or videos from the Camera Roll, you can save them as a story on Snapchat.

Step1 Once you have opened your Snapchat, tap on your Bitmoji icon. From there, proceed to the "Settings" by tapping on the gear icon.
