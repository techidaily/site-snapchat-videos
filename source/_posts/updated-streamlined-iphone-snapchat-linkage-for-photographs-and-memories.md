## Part 4: How to Make Screen Record on Snapchat without Notice?

It looks pretty embarrassing if you capture a screenshot and the other person receives a notification. The screen recording on Snapchat makes you awkward. To get rid of this embarrassment, one should use tricky and workable methods. Luckily, the section covers some of those methods. Let us have a look at each of them!

### Switching off the Internet Connection

The first method revolves around disabling the internet connection of your device. For starters, reload and refresh your Snapchat feed. Disconnect the Wi-Fi or data network, and then screen records the snap. It helps you get the task done without getting noticed, as the app doesn’t know what is happening without internet connectivity.

### Enabling the Airplane Mode

One workable method is to enable the Airplane Mode before you plan to screen record Snapchat. What happens is that the app doesn’t respond to the operation occurring as Airplane Mode is switched on. The process doesn’t send the notification to the targeted person; thus, it always works.

### Using a Third-Party Software

You can access the [third-party screen recorder](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and then perform screen recording on Snapchat. The market offers numerous apps for a similar reason. Their usage is simple as well.
