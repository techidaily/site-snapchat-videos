## A Step-by-Step Approach to Infusing Conversations with GIFs on Snapchat

![snapchat-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snapchat-poster.png)

For all informal interactions between pals, Snapchat is the go-to app. Many configurable options are available on the platform, allowing you to express your inner creative sides. Snapchat helps to put your spin on anything, whether it's just sharing random photos to your contacts or having extended chats.

The option to add GIFs to Snapchat is one such great feature. Because Snapchat is primarily a picture-sharing app, the emphasis is on making these images as engaging and imaginative as possible, and this is where animated GIFs come to play.

GIF stickers have exploded in popularity and for a good cause. The active emojis are mostly not amusing, but they also give life to your images, making your digital experience better overall.
