A cameo is an option that allows you to add your face to comic characters or animals or even create funny videos with them.

Instead of messages, **Snapchat cameos** are an innovative way to say hello, express your feelings, and so forth. It is possible to customize captions and add them to the cameos that you create.

Indeed, who would not want to have cool means to express themselves, their opinions, or tell their close friends what they feel? Snapchat offers several unique ways of expressing yourself. While you could attach videos or memes that express what you feel, with a cameo you can make that even more personalized and unique. Add your face to cool videos, animations, or pics.

You will find the functionality while you are texting and adding effects to the conversation. For this reason, the function appears in the borders of the keyboard you use.
* Once the chat page opens up, find the face icon next to the chat bar which shows above the keyboard. This leads to the emoji page along where you will find the **Snapchat cameos** option at the bottom.
* You will find the cameo icon at the bottom of this section. It looks like a face with a + sign on it. This will lead you to create the cameo video or pic.
* It starts by activating the selfie camera. It aligns the face on the camera with an outline in blue. It will instruct you to take the selfie picture.

* Once the filters are applied and captions added, you are ready to send across the cameo to your selected contact. The **Snapchat cameos** you create get added to the chat option directly.
