## Part 1: Comparing Lens Studio and Creating Your Own Lens

The two programs that we are highlighting today are Lens Studio and Create Your Own Lens. These are both fantastic programs for creating your own Snapchat lens, but they do have slightly different uses. If you are the type of person who wants to design a professional Snapchat lens, you are going to prefer Lens Studio.

But if you are hoping to come up with something creative that you can share with your friends and family, then you may love Create Your Own Lens. It is a very easy program to use, and it offers a ton of features that you may be surprised to see.

#### Snapchat lenses is for fun

The beauty of Snapchat lenses is that you can now create your own environment, which you can use each time you are taking photos or videos. Sure, you can always use the filters that are already available in the application, but not everyone would find those enough.

If you want some customization, or you just want to mess around until you get the filter that makes sense for you, Snapchat lenses are the way to go.

![lens studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Lens-Studio.JPG)

#### Lens Studio is for business

Lens Studio is perfect for businesses that may want to create unique environments for their clients, or the times when they are releasing company Snapchat posts. Say the company is hosting an event. They may want a custom graphic for that event, which is used for all the pictures and videos posted to Snapchat about the event. Using Lens Studio lets them do that with ease.

Create Your Own Lens is great when you are going to a special event, birthday party or graduating, and you want a special graphic that comes up in all your snaps. It is very intuitive to use, and is available through the App Store as a download.

![lens studio snapchat](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/len-studio-snapchat.JPG)

## Part 2: How to Use Lens Studio

#### 1\. Download Lens Studio

The first step involves downloading Lens Studio, which you can do from your computer. It is compatible with both Windows and Mac computers, and will run on any semi-modern system. According to the Snapchat team, Lens Studio is similar to the program used by their AR teams to create lenses. That means you are getting similar functionality, but with an easier to manage interface.

#### 2\. Choose Templates Page

It is normal to feel a little overwhelmed the first time you try and use this program. But that is why the templates page is so great. You can select from templates depending on the type of lens that you are hoping to create. You can just use a template, or you can incorporate your own ideas to customize the template.

There is also a Lens Studio Overview guide that you can access online, which will help you get acquainted with the program’s various features and quirks.

#### 3\. Use Studio Panels

Are you ready to create your own custom Snapchat lens? It is time to head over to Studio Panels on the application. This is the area where you can add your own 2D or 3D objects, and you can visualize how they would look as a Snapchat filter. You can add, remove, resize and drag objects to specific areas of the screen.

There are other tools accessible from the Resources panel. You can use these tools to ensure that your Snapchat lens is exactly as you want.

![lens studio panel](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lens-studio-panal.JPG)

#### 4\. Preview the Snapchat Lens You Create

The great thing about this application is that you can preview the lens before you send it out to your phone. When you are satisfied with the image on the preview, you can pair your phone with the application, and you will be able to send that Snapchat lens onto your phone through your Snapcode. It is that simple!

## Part 3: How to Create Snapchat Lenses Using Create Your Own Lens

1. There are two ways that you can access the tool for creating fun Snapchat lenses. You can either visit the website snapchat.com/create, or you can go on the “filters and lenses” section on your iOS device. If you are using Snapchat on an Android device, you will only have the option for the website. But the feature is coming to the Android version of Snapchat very soon.
2. When you are in the application or on the website, you may start to look at the different templates for Snapchat lenses. Now you can add other items into the templates, such as photographs, text or graphics.

![create snapchat](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-snapchat.JPG)

It is all up to your imagination. You can create the perfect Snapchat lens, which you can then send into your Snapchat account through your Snapcode. Of course, if you are using your iOS device to create the lens, it is already linked to your account.

Another cool feature is how you can set the location for where the Snapchat lens is available. Say you are hosting a party. You can have the Snapchat lens available to everyone who uses Snapchat within a set square footage of your home. That is an amazing way to let everyone share social media pictures and photos of your party, through the lens you created.

## Conclusion

Creating Snapchat lenses has never been easier. Whether you are a business looking to add a custom lens, or you just want to create a fun lens for a graduation or party, there are tools that make the job very easy. Using these tools will allow you to create the perfect Snapchat lens for any occasion.

## Part 2: How to Use Lens Studio

#### 1\. Download Lens Studio

The first step involves downloading Lens Studio, which you can do from your computer. It is compatible with both Windows and Mac computers, and will run on any semi-modern system. According to the Snapchat team, Lens Studio is similar to the program used by their AR teams to create lenses. That means you are getting similar functionality, but with an easier to manage interface.

#### 2\. Choose Templates Page

It is normal to feel a little overwhelmed the first time you try and use this program. But that is why the templates page is so great. You can select from templates depending on the type of lens that you are hoping to create. You can just use a template, or you can incorporate your own ideas to customize the template.

There is also a Lens Studio Overview guide that you can access online, which will help you get acquainted with the program’s various features and quirks.

![lens studio templates](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lens-studio-templates.JPG)

#### 3\. Use Studio Panels

Are you ready to create your own custom Snapchat lens? It is time to head over to Studio Panels on the application. This is the area where you can add your own 2D or 3D objects, and you can visualize how they would look as a Snapchat filter. You can add, remove, resize and drag objects to specific areas of the screen.

There are other tools accessible from the Resources panel. You can use these tools to ensure that your Snapchat lens is exactly as you want.

Another cool feature is how you can set the location for where the Snapchat lens is available. Say you are hosting a party. You can have the Snapchat lens available to everyone who uses Snapchat within a set square footage of your home. That is an amazing way to let everyone share social media pictures and photos of your party, through the lens you created.

## Conclusion

Creating Snapchat lenses has never been easier. Whether you are a business looking to add a custom lens, or you just want to create a fun lens for a graduation or party, there are tools that make the job very easy. Using these tools will allow you to create the perfect Snapchat lens for any occasion.

## Part 4: How to Make Screen Record on Snapchat without Notice?

It looks pretty embarrassing if you capture a screenshot and the other person receives a notification. The screen recording on Snapchat makes you awkward. To get rid of this embarrassment, one should use tricky and workable methods. Luckily, the section covers some of those methods. Let us have a look at each of them!

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://united.elfm.net/c/5597632/517826/4704" target="_top" id="517826"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/4704-517826" border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://united.elfm.net/i/5597632/517826/4704" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Switching off the Internet Connection

The first method revolves around disabling the internet connection of your device. For starters, reload and refresh your Snapchat feed. Disconnect the Wi-Fi or data network, and then screen records the snap. It helps you get the task done without getting noticed, as the app doesn’t know what is happening without internet connectivity.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Enabling the Airplane Mode

One workable method is to enable the Airplane Mode before you plan to screen record Snapchat. What happens is that the app doesn’t respond to the operation occurring as Airplane Mode is switched on. The process doesn’t send the notification to the targeted person; thus, it always works.

### Using a Third-Party Software

You can access the [third-party screen recorder](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and then perform screen recording on Snapchat. The market offers numerous apps for a similar reason. Their usage is simple as well.
