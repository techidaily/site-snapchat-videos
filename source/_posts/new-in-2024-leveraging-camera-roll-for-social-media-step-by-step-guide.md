### Method 1: Using a Snapchat Filter

Snapchat allows you to apply its filters on any of your camera roll's pictures. By selecting a particular photo or video from your memories or snap, you can instantly add a filter to them. Afterward, you can send the filtered image to your friends as a regular snap. However, this solution has a significant drawback that you must know. The limitation is that the receiver of the snap would be able to see that the sent picture is from the camera roll.

Step1 Open your Snapchat and swipe up to open the 'Memories'. Go to your Camera Roll and select any particular picture from there.

#### Step 3: Wait for answering

 Their phone will start ringing if they have enabled Snapchat notifications. Enabling notification will also let them know that youâ€™re calling even if they are not using the app that time. Or else, they can only get the call, while using Snapchat.

 There are 3 options to respond to a call.

1. If they click on â€˜Watchâ€™ option, they can see you, but you arenâ€™t allowed for so.
2. If they tap â€˜Joinâ€™ option, it means both of you can see and talk to each other. In case they select â€˜Ignoreâ€™ option, you will get a busy message.
3. If you tap the green camera icon the video becomes one way, where only you can see them, but they wonâ€™t see you.

 Note: By swiping the screen down, you can minimize the Snapchat video call.
