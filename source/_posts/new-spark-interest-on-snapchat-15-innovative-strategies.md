However, how to make your Snaps stand out and make sure your Snaps and Snapchat videos are seen by as many audiences as possible and are interesting enough to hold their attention?

In this article, we're going to give you some **ideas to post on Snapchat**. From generating inspiring ideas to using Snapchat for better marketing, we aim to provide you with guidance on the whole walkthrough of shining on Snapchat.

## Part 1\. Choosing Creative Topics for Snapchat Video

On the top of that, we will start with coming up with creative ideas for your Snapchat videos. If you're struggling to develop **ideas to post on Snapchat**, don't worry - we've got you covered.

Below we've provided some tips for your Snapchat videos:

### Idea 1\. Conduct Interviews Via Snaps

If you are running your Snapchat like a YouTube channel, conducting interviews on Snapchat is a perfect way to get quick, candid responses from your interviewees. To make it more fun, captivating, and engaging, you can also use captivating Snaps to add a personal touch.

All you need is: set lighting and sound, a 10-second snap with a question on it, and the interviewee. Start by introducing the person in the frame, put the snap on the screen, and let the interviewee answer your question.

To make things interesting, add [filters](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), stickers, or [lenses](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to reflect the scenarios or your personality. In the outro, provide a snap to thank the interviewee and share their Snapcode to let people follow them, a call to action, a positive phrase like thanks for watching, or your other social media handles.

### Idea 2\. Host A YouTube And Snapchat Q&A

Another great idea is to host a YouTube and Snapchat Q&A. You can film with a famous snap chatter or YouTuber and ask them a few questions. You can also ask your followers/audience to send their questions via text message or response to your stories. This will help you get your viewers involved with your content and increase engagement.

To make sure your snap Q&A goes off without a hitch, be sure to:

* Set up your Snapchat settings of **"Who Can Contact Me"** to **"Everyone"** for a while to allow for questions.
* During the session, try to acknowledge who asked the question.
* After the session, change the "**Who Can Contact Me"** setting back to **only friends** to avoid spam overload.

### Idea 1\. Create Title Cards For Longer Snapchat Stories

If you're creating a Snapchat story that is longer than the standard 10 seconds, you can use title cards to help keep your viewers engaged.

Title cards are simply images with the text you can insert into your story to help identify what's coming next. For example, if you're sharing a story about your company's history, you could use a title card at the beginning of each section to identify the different parts of the story.

For this, you can take a snap of a wall or perhaps block your camera to get a black screen and then paste your text on the picture. You can also play with the font size, style, or color to create engaging title cards.

One way to create shareable and fun content is by making full use of Snapchat's filters. For this, the app offers a ton of different filters to choose from, so you can really get creative while using them

##### 1\. Utilizing Geofilters

These are location-based filters that you can use if you are planning an event or promoting your product. Creating your own on-demand geofilters are super affordable and are priced according to location, time frame, and square footage you want, starting from $5.

However, you can only target an area between 20,000 and 5 million square feet. Moreover, they can only stay active for up to 30 days.

##### 2\. With AR/VR filters

We all love filters, don't we? Whether it's a dog filter or a flower crown, filters add a touch of fun and personality to our photos and videos. With the advent of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technology, filters are getting even more creative and immersive.

Snapchat's AR/VR filters are some of the most fun and innovative on the market, and they're constantly adding new ones to keep users engaged. You can also use these filters to create interactive content for your business.

### 1\. Techniques for Better Marketing On Snapchat

Here are some techniques to create an engaging marketing campaign on Snapchat:

### Idea 1\. Newsletter Sign-up CTAs

### Idea 3\. Sneak Peeks Of New Products

Giving your followers/customers a sneak peek of new products before they hit the shelves can excite them about your brand. This not only builds anticipation and excitement but also gives your fans a chance to be the first to know how and when to get their hands on your new products.

You can provide sneak peeks of new products on Snapchat in a number of ways. For instance, you can give short previews or teasers of products in your upcoming collection or first look at new products. You can even use Snapchat to give your fans a behind-the-scenes look at how your products are made.

Whatever approach you take, ensure that you're providing value to your audience. They should feel like they're getting something special by having a sneak peek of your new products.

### Idea 4\. Attach Your Username, Username URL, Or Snapchat Code

To get more audiences and followers on Snapchat, you can also try attaching your username, username URL, or Snapcode to your stories. These three approaches can help your customers find your account or add you as a friend on Snapchat.

To share your Snapchat username URL, open **Snapchat** and click your **Profile** icon. Tap on your **yellow Snapcode** to access more options. Tap **"Share My Profile Link"** and select the platform you want to share it with.

To share your Snapcode, simply let others scan the code via their phone's camera or tap **"Profile > Snapcode icon > Share Snapcode."**

## Part 4\. A Bonus Tip: Tracking and Analysing Snap Stats

Tracking and analyzing your snap stats can be difficult, but it's also important to do if you want to be successful on Snapchat. By understanding your snap stats, you can figure out what works and doesn't and adjust your Snapchat strategy accordingly.

So what stats should you be tracking on Snapchat? Here are a few of the most important ones:

* **Views:** This is a good metric to track if you want to see how many people are actually seeing your content. Keep an eye on your views over time to see if you're getting more or less engagement.
* **Screenshots:** Screenshots can be a good indicator of how viral your content is. If you're getting a lot of screenshots, it means people are sharing your content with others.
* **New Followers:** This will help you understand how effective your Snapchat marketing efforts are.
* **The Timing Of Your Snaps:** This will help you understand when your audience is most engaged and when they're most likely to see your snaps.

## Part 2: How To Change Voice On Snapchat With Speed Modifiers

 Do you know how to change voice on Snapchat with the speed modifiers? By altering the speed of your Snapchat video, you may change your voice sound. So, first, you have to open the Snapchat app.

1. You have to use the front facing camera so tap twice on the Snapchat camera. Then, you can see a round shaped button for recording the video. Press the button to start recording. Once you start recording the video a red line starts filling the circle around the icon. Once the recording is over, just release your finger to stop.

## Conclusion

 Although the voice filters were already available on Snapchat through some of the face filters, the new Snapchat voice changer feature is an added bonus. This feature lets you use both face filters as well as the voice filters combinedly. You may obviously, also use the voice filter alone. Select the features and make a great entry into the Snapchat land with a bang.
