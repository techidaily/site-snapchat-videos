## Introduction of how to know if someone blocked you on Snapchat?

It's a real shame when your social media accounts are permanently disabled. Everyone in the modern world depends on social media to remain in touch. As a result, being blocked may be a devastating experience for a person's mental health. In this guide, we are going to discuss how to know if someone blocked you on Snapchat?

Snapchat and other similar applications fail to inform you if your account has been blocked. I will let you know how to know if someone blocked you on Snapchat. So, you can keep your attention on the good things in life instead of the bad.

However, if you discover that how to know if someone blocked you on Snapchat, consider why this would be the case. If you're having trouble messaging someone, don't attempt to use several accounts. If you approach the situation calmly, you may learn why you were banned on Snapchat. Alternatively, the individual may have canceled your account or removed you from their list of Friends or Contacts.

A deleted account differs from a banned account in that it is no longer accessible.

## Blocked vs. removed: What's the difference?

Snapchat's blocking system differs from those other social media sites. The individual who is blocked won't know if they've been blocked since they won't know how to find out. Even if they are no longer friends, the guy who blocked them will seem to be. They'll remain in your chat list and in your friend's list, but they won't be able to see any messages you send. You won't even be able to access their blogs or other online information.

Being blocked on Snapchat, on the other hand, is a very other matter. This indicates that another person has unfriended you. Your most recent conversations with this individual may be hidden from view. You won't see them on your buddy list, but you may search for them if you know the username.

## How can you know if someone on Snapchat has banned you?

### 1.Check your recent chats with them

![way1-check-your-recent-chats-with-them](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/way1-check-your-recent-chats-with-them.png)

It's possible that the other user deleted their account or was barred if your recent conversations don't appear despite being preserved.

### 2.Send them a message if you can

You can snap someone you've spoken to in the past if you've previously interacted with them. If you notice a pending or grey indicator after sending it, they may have removed you from the contact list. 'Failed to send a message - Tap to try again' may indicate that you have been blocked. Snapchat, on the other hand, will display all of your messages as 'delivered,' even if you have been banned.

### 3.Check your list of Friends to see whether they're there

To see this list, just go to your profile & click on My Friends. If they don't show up, they may have blocked you. They might have canceled their account or disabled you from their Friends list.

### 4.Verify whether or not you can view their tales on the internet

Searching for someone active on Instagram may need you to read their recent stories first. If you're unable to, you've probably been blocked.

### 5. Verify whether you can see their Snapchat rating

![way5-verify-whether-you-can-see-their-snapchat-rating](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/way5-verify-whether-you-can-see-their-snapchat-rating.png)

Snapchat scores are only visible to friends. Otherwise, your Snapchat account has been suspended or terminated.

### 6. Use a separate account to do a name search

It's possible they deactivated their account to ensure you can use a different account to search for their username if you don't find them there. If they do appear, you may be sure they blocked you after removing you.

Snapchat hides the fact that someone has banned you from view. I really hope this information was useful to you in some manner. Approaching the individual who has obstructed you should be done with caution. Keep in mind why you were first barred, and attempt to avoid making the same error repeatedly.

### 7. Look for the person's username and full name

![way7-look-for-persons-username-full-name](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/way7-look-for-persons-username-full-name.png)

When you search for someone on Snapchat and they've banned you, you won't be able to find them. Searching for them should bring them up even if they've unfriended you on Facebook.

It's critical to know the difference between Snapchat's blocking and deleting features. If someone has banned your account, you won't be able to locate it anywhere and you won't be able to communicate with it from the blocked account either.

Even if someone removes you from the Friends list, you'll still be able to send them snaps since they'll appear on your Friends list. It's possible, though, that they won't get them if they only let their friends contact them because of their privacy settings.

Use the magnifying glass icon just at top of the screen just on the chats or snaps tab to look for the individual who you believe blocked you. If you wish to find a certain person, start by inputting their username or last name.

**Tip!**

If you are wondering how to know if someone blocked you on Snapchat, using their username is your best bet. This is due to the fact that user names are distinct from complete names.

• Efficient workflow and easy-to-understand videos.

• Even beginners can benefit from these tutorials.

**Snapchat** is one of the most popular social media platforms of the present time and certainly needs no introduction. Though, to rival other apps like Instagram and TikTok, Snapchat has recently added a “Sound” feature. With this newly-added option, users can add music to a Snapchat video pretty easily and make their snaps more interesting. In this post, I’m going to let you know how to add music to a Snapchat video without any hassle. Let’s get it started and level-up your Snapchat game!

## Part 1: What's the Sound Feature in Snapchat?

Before we learn how to add music to your Snapchat video, let’s quickly get to know about the “Sounds” feature of the app. If you have been using Instagram or TikTok, then you might be familiar with their music feature.

Similarly, in 2020, Snapchat has also included a Sound feature that lets us add music to our snaps (photos or videos). For this, you can integrate Snapchat with a streaming service like Spotify, Pandora, Apple Music, or Soundcloud. While it doesn’t include all sorts of tracks, you can find most of the popular songs so that you can easily add music to a Snapchat video and make it interesting.

Once the other person would view your snap, they can hear the music playing in the background. If they want to listen to it or know more about the song, then they can just tap on its sticker on your snap.

## Part 2: How to Add Music to a Snapchat Video on iPhone or Android?

One of the best things about Snapchat is that the overall interface of the app is pretty similar for both iOS and Android versions. Therefore, to learn how to add music on a Snapchat video, you need to follow the same process. As of now, you can find almost all the popular songs on Snapchat and can even record your own sounds.

To learn how to add music to your Snapchat video on your Android or iOS device, you can just follow this simple drill.

**Step 1: Visit the Snapchat Sound section on the app**

At first, just launch the Snapchat application on your device and tap on the camera icon from the home to start recording.

Using the rear or front camera of your device, you can now record any video on Snapchat. Once the video is recorded, you can tap on the music icon from the sidebar to add a song to a Snapchat video.

**Step 2: Search for any music to include in your Snaps**

As you would tap on the **Music** icon, you can view a list of various songs supported by Snapchat. If you want to look for anything specific, then just tap on the search icon and enter keywords to find a song of your choice.

Afterward, Snapchat will list the searched results, and you can tap on the play icon to first listen to the song. Just tap on the icon of the song and click on the “Next” button from the bottom to include it in the snap.

**Step 3: Trim and add the song to your Snapchat video**

Now, Snapchat will automatically display the snippet of the music at the bottom. You can use the left or the right slider option to trim the section of the music you want to add. Here, you also can tap on the play icon to listen to the track first.

**Step 4: Add music to your Snapchat video after recording**

That’s it! Once you have trimmed the music snippet, you can post it. You can tap on the shutter or the download icon first to save the video on your phone.

Now, you can preview the music via its sticker. You can just tap on the music sticker to change its appearance or drag it on the screen to place it anywhere you like. To change its size, you can just pinch-in or pinch-out the sticker.

In the end, just tap on the send icon to post your snap. You can add it to your story or sent it to any Snapchat contact. When they would open it, they can listen to the added song and even tap on the sticker to load it.

In this way, anyone can learn how to put music on a Snapchat video without any hassle.

## Part 3: FAQs on Adding Music to a Snapchat Video

Now when you know how to add music to your Snapchat video, let’s clear some common doubts related to it.

* **How to add your own music to a Snapchat video?**

Apart from the available songs on Snapchat, the app also lets us add the sound of our choice. For this, just click on the music icon and tap the “Create Sound” button instead. This will let you record anything or create your own music on Snapchat.

* **Why are some songs not available on Snapchat?**

The Sound feature of Snapchat only provides licensed music by collaborating with some of the biggest record labels. Therefore, while you can find most of the popular songs, chances are that some of them might be missing from the collection.

* **Why can’t I add music to my Snapchat videos?**

Well, there could be two possible reasons for this – you might be using an old version of Snapchat or the feature might not be available in your region yet. To fix this, you can just go to the Snapchat page on the App/Play Store and tap on the “Update” button. Furthermore, if the Sound feature has not been rolled out to your region, then you can just wait for a while.

As you can see, it is pretty easy to learn how to add music to a Snapchat video like a pro. With the newly-added Sounds feature, it is pretty easy to add a song to your Snapchat videos and make them more interesting. Go ahead and try this feature to make your snaps creative and share this guide with others to teach them how do you add music to a Snapchat video as well.

**Step 2: Search for any music to include in your Snaps**

As you would tap on the **Music** icon, you can view a list of various songs supported by Snapchat. If you want to look for anything specific, then just tap on the search icon and enter keywords to find a song of your choice.

Afterward, Snapchat will list the searched results, and you can tap on the play icon to first listen to the song. Just tap on the icon of the song and click on the “Next” button from the bottom to include it in the snap.

**Step 3: Trim and add the song to your Snapchat video**

Now, Snapchat will automatically display the snippet of the music at the bottom. You can use the left or the right slider option to trim the section of the music you want to add. Here, you also can tap on the play icon to listen to the track first.

**Step 4: Add music to your Snapchat video after recording**

That’s it! Once you have trimmed the music snippet, you can post it. You can tap on the shutter or the download icon first to save the video on your phone.

Now, you can preview the music via its sticker. You can just tap on the music sticker to change its appearance or drag it on the screen to place it anywhere you like. To change its size, you can just pinch-in or pinch-out the sticker.

In the end, just tap on the send icon to post your snap. You can add it to your story or sent it to any Snapchat contact. When they would open it, they can listen to the added song and even tap on the sticker to load it.

In this way, anyone can learn how to put music on a Snapchat video without any hassle.

## Part 3: FAQs on Adding Music to a Snapchat Video

Now when you know how to add music to your Snapchat video, let’s clear some common doubts related to it.

* **How to add your own music to a Snapchat video?**

Apart from the available songs on Snapchat, the app also lets us add the sound of our choice. For this, just click on the music icon and tap the “Create Sound” button instead. This will let you record anything or create your own music on Snapchat.

* **Why are some songs not available on Snapchat?**

The Sound feature of Snapchat only provides licensed music by collaborating with some of the biggest record labels. Therefore, while you can find most of the popular songs, chances are that some of them might be missing from the collection.

* **Why can’t I add music to my Snapchat videos?**

Well, there could be two possible reasons for this – you might be using an old version of Snapchat or the feature might not be available in your region yet. To fix this, you can just go to the Snapchat page on the App/Play Store and tap on the “Update” button. Furthermore, if the Sound feature has not been rolled out to your region, then you can just wait for a while.

As you can see, it is pretty easy to learn how to add music to a Snapchat video like a pro. With the newly-added Sounds feature, it is pretty easy to add a song to your Snapchat videos and make them more interesting. Go ahead and try this feature to make your snaps creative and share this guide with others to teach them how do you add music to a Snapchat video as well.
