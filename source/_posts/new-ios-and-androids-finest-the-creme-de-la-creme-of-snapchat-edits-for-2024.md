## Innovative Boomers for Dynamic Snaps on Snapchat

Social media platforms like Snapchat have gained immense popularity among teenagers and youngsters. People like to try the filters, lenses, and stickers on their snaps. This helps them to communicate with their friends in an interesting manner. These unique features offered on Snapchat are a contributing factor to its popularity.

Using Snapchat, you can not only take ordinary snaps but can also create boomerangs. The bounce feature on Snapchat was first introduced in August 2018 on all iOS devices. This feature is similar to the boomerang option available on Instagram. Through this feature, people can play their captured snap on the loop, highlighting a specific action in it. For your convenience, this article will tell **how to do a boomerang on Snapchat** in multiple ways.

## Part 1: How to Make a Bounce on Snapchat - for iOS

If you are not an Instagram user, you can still make boomerangs using Snapchat. However, you must update your Snapchat to its latest version to use the bounce feature. To update your Snapchat and learn **how to do a boomerang on Snapchat**, follow the below steps:

Step1 On your iOS device, navigate to the App Store. You then need to click on your "Profile" icon displayed in the top-right corner.

![tap on the profile icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-do-a-boomerang-on-snapchat-1.jpg)

## Part 2: Alternatives of Bounce on Snapchat - for both iOS and Android

The Bounce feature is only available on iOS devices. If you want to make a bounce on your Android smartphone, you can take help from the following easy methods. These methods can work on iOS and Android phones and will help you with **how to do a boomerang on Snapchat**.

### Method 1: Regular Loop

### Method 2: Limitless Snap

Apart from using the Regular Loop feature, you can use another exciting feature called "Limitless Snap." This feature lets you send snaps to your friends and post the stories in an endless loop. The limitless snap will play continuously until your added friend does not close it on his own. To utilize this feature, press the "Infinity" icon and select the timer from 1 to infinity to play the snaps on loop.
