## Part 3: Save Multiple Snaps to Camera Roll at Once

Many people like to capture pictures of a particular event on their Snapchat. However, if your taken snaps are not saved in the camera roll, you may have difficulty sharing the images with others on other social media apps. You can save time by saving multiple snaps to the camera roll all at once. Through the following steps, you can learn **how to save snaps to the camera roll** all at once:

Step1 Open your Snapchat and swipe up from the bottom using your finger. This will open all the captured snaps on your screen.

Step2 Now tap and hold any specific snap that will allow you to select multiple snaps. You can see the "Tick" icon on the snaps that you have selected. Once you choose all the snaps you want to save to the camera roll, tap on the "Export" button displayed below.

## Part 4: How To Change Where Photos Are Saved in Snapchat

Some people like to save the phone's storage by saving the snaps to memories. If you prefer saving the snaps in memories instead of the camera roll, you can save the phone's storage space. Conversely, some people like to export their snaps to the camera roll if multiple people use their Snapchat.

For privacy matters, people like to save the snaps to the camera roll only. If you want to change the location where the photos are saved, you can check the below instructions:

Step1 Head to your Snapchat and tap on the Profile icon displayed in the top left corner. From there, select the "Settings" icon to proceed.

![open snapchat settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/save-snaps-to-camera-roll-8.jpg)

Step2 On the settings menu, locate the option called "Memories." Now on the new menu, select the "Save Button" given under the section of "Save Destinations."
