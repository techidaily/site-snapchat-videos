## How-To: Seamless Transition of Photos From Your Device to Snapchat

Many people haven't backed up their camera roll to Snapchat due to the default settings. If you want to save each photo or video from your device on the Snapchat cloud, backing up the camera to the Memories is necessary. By doing so, you cannot lose important photos or videos from your phone.

If you change the default settings of the Memories created from the camera roll, Snapchat will automatically create a backup of your Memories. In this regard, this article will guide you on **how to back up the camera roll to Snapchat** in the easiest way.

## Part 1: Backing up automatically - Creating Snapchat Stories from your Camera Roll

If you don't want to alter the settings of your camera roll, this part will offer you an easy method. Through this method, you can create Snapchat stories from the camera roll directly. By doing so, you can instantly save the camera roll photos to your Snapchat without backing up. To make a Snapchat story from your camera roll, read the following instructions:

Step1 Open your Snapchat and swipe up from the bottom. Head to the Camera Roll section and select any photo.

Step2 After selecting a particular photo or video, hit the "Arrow" icon. Afterward, tap on the "My Story" option to create a story. For confirmation, press the "Arrow" icon again. This will create a Snapchat story instantly from your Camera Roll.

## Part 2: How to Backup your Camera Roll to Snapchat without Creating Stories

In Snapchat, you can only save the camera roll videos having a maximum of 10-second length. It indicates that you cannot save the camera roll videos which exceed the 10-second limit. Furthermore, there are various ways that enable you to make a Camera Roll backup on Snapchat. In this part, we will guide you on how to save a Camera roll photo or video on Snapchat without creating a story. Also, these steps are applicable on both Android and iOS devices:

Step1 After opening your Snapchat app, open your Memories by swiping up. Proceed to your "Camera Roll" section and long-press on any picture. This will let you select any photo or video on your Camera Roll.

## Part 3: How to Check Your Backup Progress

To ensure a complete backup of your Memories on Snapchat, a stable Wi-Fi connection is mandatory. That's why make sure to connect your phone with a stable and strong internet connection. Moreover, if you have chosen multiple photos or videos from the Camera Roll, you can save them as a story on Snapchat. However, if you want to save individual images, you will need to make their backup separately in Memories. To check your backup progress on Snapchat, navigate to the following steps:

Step1 Once you have opened your Snapchat, tap on your Bitmoji icon. From there, proceed to the "Settings" by tapping on the gear icon.

![open snapchat settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/back-up-camera-roll-to-snapchat-5.jpg)

Step2 Scroll down a little to find the option "Memories." Afterward, you can see the option "Backup Progress." If you can see the word "Complete," it means that your Memories are backed up completely. If not, connect your phone to a stable Wi-Fi connection.

## Part 4: How to Turn On the Smart Backup

A Smart Backup is an advanced option on Snapchat that lets you back up memories automatically. If you enable this feature, Snapchat will automatically create a backup through a stable internet connection. This feature allows you to easily access your Memories even if you reinstall Snapchat on another device. Moreover, you can save your phone's storage by saving photos or videos in Memories. To activate the Smart Backup feature, read the below instructions:

Step1 After opening Snapchat, head to its "Settings." In the Settings menu, locate the option "Memories."

## Steady Snapstreaks: Tips to Never Miss a Snap

With over 347million daily users, Snapchat is one of the most popular social media platforms out there, especially among millennials, and one of the things that makes it unique is its Streaks.

For those who don't have any idea about Snapchat streaks, they are essentially a measure of how often you and your friends send Snaps to each other within a 24-hour period. The longer the streak, the more points you earn.

In this article, we'll give you some **Snapchat streak ideas** to help you keep them alive and show your dedication to your friends.

## The Things You Should Know About Snapchat Streaks

Snapchat streaks are a popular way to stay connected with friends on the app. But what are Snapstreaks, and how do they work?

Below, we'll give you a quick rundown of everything you need to know about Snapchat streaks.

### (1) What Will Not Be Counted Towards Snapchat Streaks

We all know how important it is to keep up our Snapchat streaks - after all, it's a way to show how close we are to someone! But there are a few things that won't count towards your Snapstreak, even if you're still talking to your friends every day.

* **Chatting:** If you're just chatting with someone without exchanging any snaps, that won't count towards your streaks.
* **Story**: Views of your Story don't count, but if you reply to someone's story with a snap, that will keep your streaks going.
* **Memories**: Any picture from your Memories vault will not be considered a Snapstreak.
* **Group Chat:** Group chats, whether text-based or Snaps, do not contribute to a Streak.
* **Snapchat Spectacle:** Any snap sent through Snapchat spectacle won't be considered a Snapstreak interaction.

### (2) The Emojis Relevant To Snapchat Streak

There are many new emojis on Snapchat that you can use in your snaps to communicate with your friends or family in a whole new way. However, only a handful of them is related to Snapstreaks.

Here's a list of the emojis relevant to Snapchat Streak and what they mean:

* **Fire:** When you send Snaps to a contract for three consecutive days, a fire emoji will appear next to the person's name, indicating a streak has started.
* **100:** This emoji appears if you send one snap every day for 100 days.
* **Hourglass:** When you don't send a snap within 24 hours to someone that you have started the streak with, an hourglass emoji will appear next to the person's name, indicating that the Snapstreak is about to end.
* **Face with Sunglasses**: This emoji reflects that you and your friends are mutual besties.
* **Hearts:** There are three kinds of heart emojis: Double Pink Hearts, Red, and Yellow. The former indicates Super BFF, while the second shows that you and your friend are BFFs. The third one is for Besties.
* **Mountain**: Many claims that a unicorn-type emoji will appear when you have a very long steak but details of this emoji are not available in Snapchat documentation.
* **Smiling Face**: This emoji appears when you and your friends are best friends.

![sending blank screen as snap](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/sending-blank-screen-as-snap.jpg)

**Idea 3\. Use Emojis And Bitmojis**

You can also add emojis or Bitmojis to your photos to make them look more interesting and fun. Simply open up the Snapchat app, click a picture, and tap on the emoji icon to select the emoji or Bitmoji that you want to add to your Snap. You can even resize and move them around to get it just right.

**Idea 4\. Snap With Your Pets**

We all love our pets - and we also like staying connected with our friends on Snapchat. So why not combine the two? Occasionally take a picture of your pet using the app and send it to your besties to make their day and keep the streak alive!

![snap with pet to maintain streak](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/snap-with-pet-to-maintain-streak.jpg)

![streak daily food](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/streak-daily-food.jpg)

### Tip 2\. Seize Occasions And Keep Your Snapchat Sneak Alive

To keep your Snapchat streak alive, try to seize any opportunity you can to take pictures and send them to friends. Below are some ideas to do this:

**Idea 1\. The First Day Matters**

Many people choose to start their streaks on special days because it helps them remember to keep them alive. For example, if you start your streak on your birthday, you'll always remember to keep the streak going on, and it will also help you to grab the attention of people.

**Idea 2\. Memorable Day**

We all have memorable days in our lives, like a milestone, graduation, or special event that we want to remember forever. What is a better way to commemorate them than with a Snap? Your friends and family will appreciate it, and you will be able to keep your streak alive for days to come.

**Idea 3\. Streak While Traveling**

Whenever you are on a trip, travel to your office/college, or head out to run some errands, remember to take a picture of the surroundings that look interesting and send it to whom you are establishing the streak.

![send snapstreak while traveling](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/send-snapstreak-while-traveling.jpg)

### Tip 3\. Organize Your Snapchat And Your Time

Are you trying to get the most out of Snapchat without letting it take over your life? Below we've provided some ideas to help you organize your time and your snaps.

**Idea 1\. Edit the Name of your Snapchat Friends**

To avoid losing your Snapchat streaks with any of your contacts, you should start editing their names. Snapchat lists your most contacted friends at the top, so you might not see the others who are lower on your list. Editing their names to include something that will help you search for them will make it easier to avoid forgetting to send them a snap regularly.

![edit the name of your snapchat friend](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/edit-the-name-of-your-snapchat-friend.jpg)

**Idea 2\. Pin Your Conversations**

If you want to keep someone at the top of your chat list, consider pinning their chat. This will also ultimately help you send snaps to them without breaking the streak.

![pin conversation in snapchat](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/pin-conversation-in-snapchat.jpg)

**Idea 3\. Stick to a Particular Time of the Day**

You will gain more by starting your Snapstreaks later on in the day, especially if you are only sending one snap per day. This way, the hourglass emoji will be visible for a considerable amount of time before it expires.

**Idea 4\. Check Your Filters**

If you're trying to keep up with multiple Snapstreaks at once, it's easy to forget who you're on a streak with. But there's a way to see them without going to your list of friends.

Whenever you're about to send a new snap, swipe through the filters. Here, you'll see a special Snapchat streak filter, which will show how many consecutive days of successful streak you have in big white numbers next to the fire emoji.

## Conclusion

In this article, we've compiled a list of fun and creative **Snapchat streak ideas** to help you stay connected with your friends.

Hopefully, by following these tips, you can now keep your Snapchat streak alive and stay connected with your contacts in a better and more engaging way!
