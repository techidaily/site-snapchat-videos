Technology, certainly, has come a long way. In this era of digitalization, one can easily interact with friends on social media. With the emergence of social media, it has now become convenient to maintain social connections and support networks that otherwise wouldn’t have been possible. Social networking platforms have made staying connected with friends, family, and other acquaintances easier than ever.

Snapchat is one such platform that has gained immense popularity over recent years. A multimedia messaging app, it allows you to share pictures and videos with your friends and dear ones.

However, by the end of June 2021, Snapchat claimed to have increased its global daily active users to 293 million.

* [Part 2: 20 Best Filters & Lenses On Snapchat to Use in 2021](#part2)
* [Part 3: FAQs About Snapchat Filters & Lenses](#part3)

## Part 1: What Are the Differences Between Snapchat Filters and Lenses?

Snapchat filters are static overlays and sit on the top of your photo or video. In contrast, Snapchat lenses are dynamic, augmented reality animations that alter your voice along with your appearance as you move on the screen. Unlike filters that are added after taking a photo, lenses are displayed while you’re taking the photo.

The best filters on Snapchat let you change a snap’s tint or change the direction or speed in which your video is played back. On the other hand, Snapchat lenses work by utilizing facial recognition software to track your features and apply an animation that follows your facial movements. While lenses can change the sound of your voice and the appearance of your face, filters can only add color tones, messages, customized images, and icons to your snaps.

The photo and video sharing app allow you to make your own filters and lenses. Creating a filter on Snapchat isn’t free as you will have to pay a certain amount based on the filter’s square foot. However, when it comes to making your own Snapchat lens, you won’t have to pay any fees as the entire process is free.

## Part 1: What Are the Differences Between Snapchat Filters and Lenses?

Snapchat filters are static overlays and sit on the top of your photo or video. In contrast, Snapchat lenses are dynamic, augmented reality animations that alter your voice along with your appearance as you move on the screen. Unlike filters that are added after taking a photo, lenses are displayed while you’re taking the photo.

The best filters on Snapchat let you change a snap’s tint or change the direction or speed in which your video is played back. On the other hand, Snapchat lenses work by utilizing facial recognition software to track your features and apply an animation that follows your facial movements. While lenses can change the sound of your voice and the appearance of your face, filters can only add color tones, messages, customized images, and icons to your snaps.

The photo and video sharing app allow you to make your own filters and lenses. Creating a filter on Snapchat isn’t free as you will have to pay a certain amount based on the filter’s square foot. However, when it comes to making your own Snapchat lens, you won’t have to pay any fees as the entire process is free.

#### 2\. Rainbow Makeup Snapchat Filter

If you want some color to your face, use the rainbow makeup filter. Once you’re ready, just scan the snapcode to get started. The filter will activate and your camera will turn on. You will be wearing virtual makeup – lipstick, eyeliner, and eyeshadow too. The great part is that your eyeshadow will change colors and this is why it’s called rainbow makeup.

#### 3\. WOW Snapchat Filter

With this filter, you can give yourself a doll-like look. Using this filter will change the look of your eyes completely – they will be big, bubbly – just like a doll’s. If anything, these effects will be the highlight of your snap. You will have pink cheeks. It will appear as if you have applied a generous amount of blush.

#### 4\. Skin Smoother Snapchat Filter

Want to smooth out your skin without anyone being able to see your blemishes? Unlock the yellow snapcode to activate and use Skin Smother – one of the best Snapchat filters for beauty. Wondering how? Simply look at the camera and the filter will automatically give you flawless skin without you having to do anything.

#### 5\. Simple Look Snapchat Filter

When it comes to makeup, simple is the way to go. If that’s your preference, this is the ideal beauty filter for you. Scan the snapcode, activate the effect, and turn the camera around so that your face is the center of the screen. Once the filter recognizes your face, your appearance will slightly change. Your eyebrows will be cleaner and you will be wearing mascara and eyeliner!
