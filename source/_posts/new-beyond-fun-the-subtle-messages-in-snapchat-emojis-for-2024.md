If you’re a Snapchat user, you will have spotted the [emojis](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that appear in your friends list next to the names of your friends. These **Snapchat emojis** don’t simply remain the same forever, but instead change over the course of time, and the changes themselves are based on the way that you interact with your friend. Only you are able to see the emojis. The Snapchat emojis themselves include stars, hearts, faces and more.

* [**Part2: How to change the streak emojis on Snapchat**](#part2)
* [**Part3: How to get a Bitmoji on Snapchat**](#part3)
* [**Part4: Why to use Snapchat emojis**](#part4)

## Part 1: What do exactly the Snapchat emojis mean?

In this section, we will tell you all about the different emojis on Snapchat. If you’ve been wondering what the Snap emoji meanings actually are, read on. A Gold Star next to someone’s name means they have replaced your snaps during the past 24 hours. A Yellow Star means you are #1 best friends with one another. You will send your largest amount of snaps to them and vice versa.

A Red Heart snap emoji is used to say that you have been #1 Bfs for a fortnight without interruption, whilst a Pink Heart Snapchat best friend emoji tells that that this has been the case for two months. If you see a baby emoji, this means you have only recently become friends with the person.

![snapchat emojis](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snapchat-emojis.JPG)

Have you seen a Face with Sunglasses? This means the person is B.Fs with one of your best friends and you send plenty of snaps to someone that they send many snaps to. A Grimacing Face tells you that your #1 is also their #1 friend and that the person you send the most snaps to is the same person they send the vast majority of their snaps to.

The Smirking Face shows that you are one of their B.Fs without this being reciprocated. In other words, they send you many snaps but you don’t return the favor. A Smiling Face means that you are good friends with someone but they aren’t quite your #1 B.F.

## Part 2: How to change the streak emojis on Snapchat

If you’re not happy with the emojis that you are seeing or you feel that they are not accurate for the person in question, don’t worry – these can easily be changed. You can switch the emojis by taking the following steps.

* Open Snapchat and swipe down
* Tap Settings
* Tap Manage Preferences
* Tap Friend Emojis
* Tap the icon that you want to change
* Tap the emoji that you wish to use

## Part 3: How to get a Bitmoji on Snapchat

Snapchat purchased Bitmoji creator Bitstrips in 2016 in an attempt to capitalise on the popularity of emojis. It is now possible to link your Bitmoji account to your Snapchat one, and it only takes a few moments to connect the two. By doing so, you can enjoy greater customisation options and enhance the experience of using Snapchat.

Take these steps if you wish to get a personal Bitmoji on Snapchat.

#### 1\. Open your Snapchat settings

Swipe down on your home screen, tapping the gear icon located in the top right-hand corner of your screen.

You can find this in the ‘My Account’ section. Those that have already registered with Bitmoji will be able to link their account in the next step, but if you haven’t, you will need to set up a new Bitmoji account.

![bitmoji](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/bitmoji-setting.JPG)

#### 2\. Agree and connect

You will now be able to link your Bitmoji account up to your Snapchat account. This means you can easily share your very own Bitmoji character with your followers on Snapchat and make the experience of using the service even more fun and personal to you.

![bitmoji-create](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/bitmoji-create.JPG)

## Part 4: Why to use Snapchat emojis

There are many great reasons for using Snapchat. The platform first appeared way back in September and has attracted millions upon millions of users since then. Snapchat may be strongly associated with teenagers, but it is used by adults of all ages. When you use Snapchat, the content you share is more direct and personal and is only seen by the people you want to see it, for ten seconds only. Snapchat is great for privacy, and if anyone attempts to take a screenshot of your content you will be notified.

Another reason so many people use Snapchat is that there are no complex settings to leave you confused. It also simplifies the video calling process and makes it much less complicated than other video communication platforms. Snapchat has also become a major marketing tool for businesses around the world, allowing them to connect with and promote their services to a wider range of tech-loving users.

How to create a video best fit Snapchat? With more than 240 million active daily users, Snapchat is one of the most popular social media networks globally. It is also an instant messaging app that allows its users to express themselves visually in a diverse variety of manners including photos, videos, stories, stickers, emoji, and more.

One of the best features of Snapchat that makes it so attractive among the young audience is its mobile-oriented user interface. Snapchat was the first social networking platform to introduce the concept of daily stories which was widely adopted by other instant messengers as well including Instagram and WhatsApp. Since it is a mobile-oriented platform, you need to create and edit your videos in a certain way to make sure they are the best fit for Snapchat.

## What Are the Ideal Features of a Snapchat Video?

Snapchat is highly optimized for vertical viewing which means that all the content needs to be served in portrait aspect ratio instead of landscape used by YouTube and other video platforms. You need to ensure that every aspect of your video is perfect before you can upload it for Snapchat on Mac. Here are some of the key features that you must not forget.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/snapchat.jpg)

* **Resolution** \- The ideal resolution of a Snapchat video is **1080 x 1920** pixels which is known as full HD. This resolution will ensure that your video loads in the right way and remains sharp and crisp for an excellent viewing experience.
* **Video Format** \- The recommended video format for Snapchat clips is **MP4 and MOV. Y**ou can use either of those formats on your Mac.
* **Aspect Ratio** \- This is one of the key aspects of any video that determines the orientation of viewing. For a perfect Snapchat video, it is recommended that you keep the aspect ratio to **9:16**.
* **Video Length Size** \- Remember that Snapchat isn't like YouTube and serves an audience that wants micro-entertainment. This is why the recommended time for your video is **3 to 10 seconds** with the video size **not exceeding 32 MB**. Otherwise, the Snapchat audience may not respond well to your videos.

That is why it is crucial that your Snapchat video has all the ideal features so your audience can enjoy the viewing experience as intended instead of attempting to manipulate their phones to be able to see the video clearly. It will create an unpleasant and frustrating experience and your viewers might not stay with you.

One of the best features of Snapchat that makes it so attractive among the young audience is its mobile-oriented user interface.

## What Are the Ideal Features of a Snapchat Video?

Snapchat is highly optimized for vertical viewing which means that all the content needs to be served in portrait aspect ratio instead of landscape used by YouTube and other video platforms. You need to ensure that every aspect of your video is perfect before you can upload it for Snapchat on Mac. Here are some of the key features that you must not forget.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/snapchat.jpg)

* **Resolution** \- The ideal resolution of a Snapchat video is **1080 x 1920** pixels which is known as full HD. This resolution will ensure that your video loads in the right way and remains sharp and crisp for an excellent viewing experience.
* **Video Format** \- The recommended video format for Snapchat clips is **MP4 and MOV. Y**ou can use either of those formats on your Mac.
* **Aspect Ratio** \- This is one of the key aspects of any video that determines the orientation of viewing. For a perfect Snapchat video, it is recommended that you keep the aspect ratio to **9:16**.
* **Video Length Size** \- Remember that Snapchat isn't like YouTube and serves an audience that wants micro-entertainment. This is why the recommended time for your video is **3 to 10 seconds** with the video size **not exceeding 32 MB**. Otherwise, the Snapchat audience may not respond well to your videos.

That is why it is crucial that your Snapchat video has all the ideal features so your audience can enjoy the viewing experience as intended instead of attempting to manipulate their phones to be able to see the video clearly. It will create an unpleasant and frustrating experience and your viewers might not stay with you.
