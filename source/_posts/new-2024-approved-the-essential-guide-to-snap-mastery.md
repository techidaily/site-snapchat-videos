## Part 1\. Choosing Creative Topics for Snapchat Video

On the top of that, we will start with coming up with creative ideas for your Snapchat videos. If you're struggling to develop **ideas to post on Snapchat**, don't worry - we've got you covered.

Below we've provided some tips for your Snapchat videos:

### Idea 1\. Conduct Interviews Via Snaps

If you are running your Snapchat like a YouTube channel, conducting interviews on Snapchat is a perfect way to get quick, candid responses from your interviewees. To make it more fun, captivating, and engaging, you can also use captivating Snaps to add a personal touch.

All you need is: set lighting and sound, a 10-second snap with a question on it, and the interviewee. Start by introducing the person in the frame, put the snap on the screen, and let the interviewee answer your question.

To make things interesting, add [filters](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), stickers, or [lenses](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to reflect the scenarios or your personality. In the outro, provide a snap to thank the interviewee and share their Snapcode to let people follow them, a call to action, a positive phrase like thanks for watching, or your other social media handles.

### Idea 2\. Host A YouTube And Snapchat Q&A

Another great idea is to host a YouTube and Snapchat Q&A. You can film with a famous snap chatter or YouTuber and ask them a few questions. You can also ask your followers/audience to send their questions via text message or response to your stories. This will help you get your viewers involved with your content and increase engagement.

To make sure your snap Q&A goes off without a hitch, be sure to:

* Set up your Snapchat settings of **"Who Can Contact Me"** to **"Everyone"** for a while to allow for questions.
* During the session, try to acknowledge who asked the question.
* After the session, change the "**Who Can Contact Me"** setting back to **only friends** to avoid spam overload.

### Idea 3\. Fun Tidbits

Snapchat is an excellent platform to get your audience engaged with your brand by creating fun tidbits to get more traffic.

You can create short videos or images designed to be entertaining and informative. For example, Amazon's Snapchat posts stories of their employees carving pumpkins and posting them to their followers. This is a creative and fun solution to reach new customers and create a brand personality.

![amazon tidbit on snapchat](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/amazon-tidbit-on-snapchat.jpg)

### Idea 4\. Behind-The-Scenes Footage

Sharing BTS footage of you and your team hard at work can be interesting and informative for your followers. This will give them a look at the inner workings of your company and how you create your products or services. This type of content can also be used to show off your team's personality and culture.

We have listed why Behind-the-scenes footages are useful for your reference:

* Helps build trust with your audience.
* Allows you to humanize your brand or business and make it more relatable.
* Enables you to connect with your audience on a deeper level.

There are numerous ways to use BTS footage to boost your business. For example, you can use it to create a more personal connection with your customers, increase transparency and build trust.

## Part 2\. Snapchat Post Ideas for Content Creation

Above is about some creative ideas for picking topics for your Snapchat videos. Apart from that, the video's content is also important to hold the audience's attention. Whether you're a blogger, a small business owner, or just someone who likes to create content, unique presenting ways can help you stand out on Snapchat.

If you're not sure where to start, here are some ideas for Snapchat content that you can create:

### Idea 1\. Create Title Cards For Longer Snapchat Stories

If you're creating a Snapchat story that is longer than the standard 10 seconds, you can use title cards to help keep your viewers engaged.

Title cards are simply images with the text you can insert into your story to help identify what's coming next. For example, if you're sharing a story about your company's history, you could use a title card at the beginning of each section to identify the different parts of the story.

For this, you can take a snap of a wall or perhaps block your camera to get a black screen and then paste your text on the picture. You can also play with the font size, style, or color to create engaging title cards.

![title cards for snapchat stories](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/title-cards-for-snapchat-stories.jpg)

### Idea 2\. Adding Music To Your Video

Adding music to your video on Snapchat is important because this can help set the mood and tone of your video, express yourself or your personality, and make the content more fun and interesting to watch.

You can [add music from the Snapchat build-in library](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) or find resources from third-party websites, such as:

* [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/music/)
* [Bensound](https://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music/2)
* [Mixkit](https://mixkit.co/free-stock-music/)
* [Tunetank](https://tunetank.com/)
* [Motionarray](https://motionarray.com/browse/royalty-free-music/)

### Idea 3\. Make Full Use of Snapchat's Filters

One way to create shareable and fun content is by making full use of Snapchat's filters. For this, the app offers a ton of different filters to choose from, so you can really get creative while using them

##### 1\. Utilizing Geofilters

These are location-based filters that you can use if you are planning an event or promoting your product. Creating your own on-demand geofilters are super affordable and are priced according to location, time frame, and square footage you want, starting from $5.

However, you can only target an area between 20,000 and 5 million square feet. Moreover, they can only stay active for up to 30 days.

![snapchat on demand geo filters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/snapchat-on-demand-geo-filters.jpg)

##### 2\. With AR/VR filters

We all love filters, don't we? Whether it's a dog filter or a flower crown, filters add a touch of fun and personality to our photos and videos. With the advent of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technology, filters are getting even more creative and immersive.

Snapchat's AR/VR filters are some of the most fun and innovative on the market, and they're constantly adding new ones to keep users engaged. You can also use these filters to create interactive content for your business.

For example, Dior created a Men Saddle Belt filter to promote its product and in turn, gained more sales, brand recognition as well as engagement.

![dior filter on snapchat](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/dior-filter-on-snapchat.jpg)

##### 3\. Using Filters In Your Snaps Or Stories

When you are taking a Snap or creating a story, you can add filters to your photos or videos to add some visual interest and variation. These filters can change the color of your picture, add text or graphics, or even give them a fun effect.

Applying filters to your snaps is easy - just swipe through the options to find the perfect look. You can even use two or more filters at once by holding down on your screen to keep your current one set while you swipe to add more.

To find more fun and interesting hidden filters, read our article: [How to find Snapchat hidden filters naturally](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

### Idea 4\. Adopting Lenses

When it comes to Snapchat, there are two things that users love: filters and lenses!

While filters enhance your photos, lenses take Snapchat to a whole new level by adding animations and effects to your photos and videos. And the best part is, there are lenses for just about everything!

So, how can you use lenses to create engaging Snapchat content? Here are a few ideas:

* Add fun animations and effects to your photos and videos.
* Create custom snaps that show off your brand personality.
* Make your content unique and engaging to stand out from the rest.

Not sure where to start? Below, we'll share some of our favorite marketing and promotional content **ideas to post on Snapchat:**

A Quick Guide:

1. [1\. Techniques for Better Marketing On Snapchat](#part3-1)
2. [2\. Ideas for Better Promotion on Snapchat](#part3-2)

### 1\. Techniques for Better Marketing On Snapchat

Here are some techniques to create an engaging marketing campaign on Snapchat:

### Idea 1\. Newsletter Sign-up CTAs

Adding a newsletter sign-up [CTA](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/call-action-cta.asp) to your Snapchat marketing campaign can help you grow your email list and keep your audience engaged. Here's how to do it:

* Create a beautiful and compelling newsletter sign-up CTA.
* Add the CTA to your Snapchat story.
* Encourage your audience to sign up for your newsletter.
* Follow up with your new subscribers and welcome them to your community.

### Idea 2\. Use Short Links

Since you cannot add clickable links to your snaps, using a shortened URL is an excellent approach to help people follow up on your links.

To get started, you need to find a URL shortener service such as [bitly.com](https://bitly.com/) and then begin sharing your shortened URLs with your Snapchat followers. You can add them to your snaps or post them in your story.

### Idea 3\. Sneak Peeks Of New Products

Giving your followers/customers a sneak peek of new products before they hit the shelves can excite them about your brand. This not only builds anticipation and excitement but also gives your fans a chance to be the first to know how and when to get their hands on your new products.

You can provide sneak peeks of new products on Snapchat in a number of ways. For instance, you can give short previews or teasers of products in your upcoming collection or first look at new products. You can even use Snapchat to give your fans a behind-the-scenes look at how your products are made.

Whatever approach you take, ensure that you're providing value to your audience. They should feel like they're getting something special by having a sneak peek of your new products.

### Idea 4\. Attach Your Username, Username URL, Or Snapchat Code

To get more audiences and followers on Snapchat, you can also try attaching your username, username URL, or Snapcode to your stories. These three approaches can help your customers find your account or add you as a friend on Snapchat.

To share your Snapchat username URL, open **Snapchat** and click your **Profile** icon. Tap on your **yellow Snapcode** to access more options. Tap **"Share My Profile Link"** and select the platform you want to share it with.

To share your Snapcode, simply let others scan the code via their phone's camera or tap **"Profile > Snapcode icon > Share Snapcode."**

![share snapcode or profile url](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/share-snapcode-or-profile-url.jpg)

If you are a regular Snapchat user, you may want to learn about the Snapchat lens and how it can help you. We will help you get started. Here is our step by step guide on how to make Snapchat lenses.

* [**Part1: Comparing Lens Studio and Creating Your Own Lens**](#part1)
* [**Part2: How to Use Lens Studio**](#part2)
* [**Part3: How to Create Snapchat Lenses Using Create Your Own Lens**](#part3)

## Part 1: Comparing Lens Studio and Creating Your Own Lens

The two programs that we are highlighting today are Lens Studio and Create Your Own Lens. These are both fantastic programs for creating your own Snapchat lens, but they do have slightly different uses. If you are the type of person who wants to design a professional Snapchat lens, you are going to prefer Lens Studio.

But if you are hoping to come up with something creative that you can share with your friends and family, then you may love Create Your Own Lens. It is a very easy program to use, and it offers a ton of features that you may be surprised to see.

#### Snapchat lenses is for fun

The beauty of Snapchat lenses is that you can now create your own environment, which you can use each time you are taking photos or videos. Sure, you can always use the filters that are already available in the application, but not everyone would find those enough.

If you want some customization, or you just want to mess around until you get the filter that makes sense for you, Snapchat lenses are the way to go.

![lens studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Lens-Studio.JPG)

#### Lens Studio is for business

Lens Studio is perfect for businesses that may want to create unique environments for their clients, or the times when they are releasing company Snapchat posts. Say the company is hosting an event. They may want a custom graphic for that event, which is used for all the pictures and videos posted to Snapchat about the event. Using Lens Studio lets them do that with ease.

Create Your Own Lens is great when you are going to a special event, birthday party or graduating, and you want a special graphic that comes up in all your snaps. It is very intuitive to use, and is available through the App Store as a download.

![lens studio snapchat](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/len-studio-snapchat.JPG)

## Part 2: How to Use Lens Studio

#### 1\. Download Lens Studio

The first step involves downloading Lens Studio, which you can do from your computer. It is compatible with both Windows and Mac computers, and will run on any semi-modern system. According to the Snapchat team, Lens Studio is similar to the program used by their AR teams to create lenses. That means you are getting similar functionality, but with an easier to manage interface.

#### 2\. Choose Templates Page

It is normal to feel a little overwhelmed the first time you try and use this program. But that is why the templates page is so great. You can select from templates depending on the type of lens that you are hoping to create. You can just use a template, or you can incorporate your own ideas to customize the template.

There is also a Lens Studio Overview guide that you can access online, which will help you get acquainted with the program’s various features and quirks.

![lens studio templates](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lens-studio-templates.JPG)

#### 3\. Use Studio Panels

Are you ready to create your own custom Snapchat lens? It is time to head over to Studio Panels on the application. This is the area where you can add your own 2D or 3D objects, and you can visualize how they would look as a Snapchat filter. You can add, remove, resize and drag objects to specific areas of the screen.

There are other tools accessible from the Resources panel. You can use these tools to ensure that your Snapchat lens is exactly as you want.

![lens studio panel](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lens-studio-panal.JPG)

#### 4\. Preview the Snapchat Lens You Create

The great thing about this application is that you can preview the lens before you send it out to your phone. When you are satisfied with the image on the preview, you can pair your phone with the application, and you will be able to send that Snapchat lens onto your phone through your Snapcode. It is that simple!

![preview lens studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/preview-snapchat.JPG)

## Part 3: How to Create Snapchat Lenses Using Create Your Own Lens

1. There are two ways that you can access the tool for creating fun Snapchat lenses. You can either visit the website snapchat.com/create, or you can go on the “filters and lenses” section on your iOS device. If you are using Snapchat on an Android device, you will only have the option for the website. But the feature is coming to the Android version of Snapchat very soon.
2. When you are in the application or on the website, you may start to look at the different templates for Snapchat lenses. Now you can add other items into the templates, such as photographs, text or graphics.

![create snapchat](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-snapchat.JPG)

It is all up to your imagination. You can create the perfect Snapchat lens, which you can then send into your Snapchat account through your Snapcode. Of course, if you are using your iOS device to create the lens, it is already linked to your account.

Another cool feature is how you can set the location for where the Snapchat lens is available. Say you are hosting a party. You can have the Snapchat lens available to everyone who uses Snapchat within a set square footage of your home. That is an amazing way to let everyone share social media pictures and photos of your party, through the lens you created.

## Conclusion

Creating Snapchat lenses has never been easier. Whether you are a business looking to add a custom lens, or you just want to create a fun lens for a graduation or party, there are tools that make the job very easy.

## Part 1: Comparing Lens Studio and Creating Your Own Lens

The two programs that we are highlighting today are Lens Studio and Create Your Own Lens. These are both fantastic programs for creating your own Snapchat lens, but they do have slightly different uses. If you are the type of person who wants to design a professional Snapchat lens, you are going to prefer Lens Studio.

But if you are hoping to come up with something creative that you can share with your friends and family, then you may love Create Your Own Lens. It is a very easy program to use, and it offers a ton of features that you may be surprised to see.

#### Snapchat lenses is for fun

The beauty of Snapchat lenses is that you can now create your own environment, which you can use each time you are taking photos or videos. Sure, you can always use the filters that are already available in the application, but not everyone would find those enough.

If you want some customization, or you just want to mess around until you get the filter that makes sense for you, Snapchat lenses are the way to go.

#### Lens Studio is for business

Lens Studio is perfect for businesses that may want to create unique environments for their clients, or the times when they are releasing company Snapchat posts. Say the company is hosting an event. They may want a custom graphic for that event, which is used for all the pictures and videos posted to Snapchat about the event. Using Lens Studio lets them do that with ease.

Create Your Own Lens is great when you are going to a special event, birthday party or graduating, and you want a special graphic that comes up in all your snaps. It is very intuitive to use, and is available through the App Store as a download.

## Part 2: How to Use Lens Studio

#### 1\. Download Lens Studio

The first step involves downloading Lens Studio, which you can do from your computer. It is compatible with both Windows and Mac computers, and will run on any semi-modern system. According to the Snapchat team, Lens Studio is similar to the program used by their AR teams to create lenses. That means you are getting similar functionality, but with an easier to manage interface.

#### 2\. Choose Templates Page

It is normal to feel a little overwhelmed the first time you try and use this program. But that is why the templates page is so great. You can select from templates depending on the type of lens that you are hoping to create. You can just use a template, or you can incorporate your own ideas to customize the template.

There is also a Lens Studio Overview guide that you can access online, which will help you get acquainted with the program’s various features and quirks.

![lens studio templates](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lens-studio-templates.JPG)

#### 3\. Use Studio Panels

Are you ready to create your own custom Snapchat lens? It is time to head over to Studio Panels on the application. This is the area where you can add your own 2D or 3D objects, and you can visualize how they would look as a Snapchat filter. You can add, remove, resize and drag objects to specific areas of the screen.

There are other tools accessible from the Resources panel. You can use these tools to ensure that your Snapchat lens is exactly as you want.

![lens studio panel](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lens-studio-panal.JPG)

#### 4\. Preview the Snapchat Lens You Create

The great thing about this application is that you can preview the lens before you send it out to your phone. When you are satisfied with the image on the preview, you can pair your phone with the application, and you will be able to send that Snapchat lens onto your phone through your Snapcode. It is that simple!

![preview lens studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/preview-snapchat.JPG)

## Part 3: How to Create Snapchat Lenses Using Create Your Own Lens

1. There are two ways that you can access the tool for creating fun Snapchat lenses. You can either visit the website snapchat.com/create, or you can go on the “filters and lenses” section on your iOS device. If you are using Snapchat on an Android device, you will only have the option for the website. But the feature is coming to the Android version of Snapchat very soon.
2. When you are in the application or on the website, you may start to look at the different templates for Snapchat lenses. Now you can add other items into the templates, such as photographs, text or graphics.

![create snapchat](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-snapchat.JPG)

It is all up to your imagination. You can create the perfect Snapchat lens, which you can then send into your Snapchat account through your Snapcode. Of course, if you are using your iOS device to create the lens, it is already linked to your account.

Another cool feature is how you can set the location for where the Snapchat lens is available. Say you are hosting a party. You can have the Snapchat lens available to everyone who uses Snapchat within a set square footage of your home. That is an amazing way to let everyone share social media pictures and photos of your party, through the lens you created.

## Conclusion

Creating Snapchat lenses has never been easier. Whether you are a business looking to add a custom lens, or you just want to create a fun lens for a graduation or party, there are tools that make the job very easy. Using these tools will allow you to create the perfect Snapchat lens for any occasion.
