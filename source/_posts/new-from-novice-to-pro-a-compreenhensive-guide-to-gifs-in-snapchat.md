Snapchat has taken over the selfie game since it has first been launched. Its lenses and filters are quite popular and dominating in the selfie game all around us. These filters can be a lot of fun, from changing your hairstyle to changing your background.

Snapchat offers its users almost every type of filter you can imagine. Nearly half a million filters are created every single month, which are perfectly working. From kids to grown-ups, everyone uses these filters for fun, to make themselves look weird, cool, or just a bit nicer. Snapchat has plenty of lenses and cool filters, making people fall in love with the app. People can also create their filters and help them engage with their brands and businesses. Let's explore some of the best Snapchat filters of 2021!

## Part 1: Most Popular Snapchat Filters for Selfies in 2021

**Let's have a look at the most popular Snapchat filters for selfies as we all know there's a big range to choose from!**

#### 1\.  Fire Sunglasses

Whenever the users are feeling energetic and motivated, they use the "fire sunglasses" filter. They want to show everyone that they're on fire, and there couldn't be a better filter than this. It provides the users with a pair of glasses with fire on the glass, which adds to the energy.

The fire on the contacts gives you a fiery and relaxed look that catches people's attention. People can use it after their workouts or for motivational posts. This filter puts up an uplifting mood and gives you good vibes, but it might not be best suited for everyone.

#### 2\.  Neon Horns

The Classic filter, the devil's horn but in neon! Incredibly catchy to the eye and gives you a devilish look. This filter is a classic and is here to stay for a long time; there's no doubt in that.

For the first time, Horn Filters have taken one step further and given it a neon effect, making it even more appealing. The user can change the horn color; various options have been offered, such as black and white. Some more color options include lime green, magenta, orange, and light blue. It is an evergreen filter but has limited use. Want to know the best part? It sits perfectly according to your filter and does not glitch at all.

#### 3\.  Cartoon 3D Style

Cartoon 3D Style, one of the most popular filters on Snapchat and has every right to be! It gives you that unique specific animated look making you look like you just stepped out of a Disney movie. This filter adjusts itself according to our face cut and turns into Disney cartoons such as Kristoff.

People love to fool around with funny filters, and this one here has to be the best of them all. It gets better: from children to adults, everyone has undoubtedly used this filter. This filter has a soft shading giving it that artistic look like it had been hand-drawn; it's pretty fun when you make different faces with the filter on your face. This makes it the best filter on Snapchat!

#### 4\.  Scary Mask

When people get bored from typical filters and don't get much response, they use funny or scary filters, which are way more fun. But here's the kicker: this filter covers half your face with a golden skull mask and turns your eyes into a golden flame color too. If we look at this from a different perspective, this can also spread awareness to wear masks during these challenging times. This filter has received so much response from the Snapchat users and finds a place in the "best filters on Snapchat" list!

You can even send these pictures to your loved ones and see how happy they get. Stuff like this is best when shared, especially with your loved ones, and experience some mutual good vibes.

Even when you feel lonely, it will bring you closer to the people far away from you, and you can even keep these memories safe with both of you. Isn't that great? This filter proves to be one of the best Snapchat filters for selfies.
