## Part1: How to Make Snapchat Multi Video Easily

 If you wish to make a multi video in a few minutes very quickly, you just need to tap the big round button on the screen of the camera app and hold it.

 Donât leave the button even after the time is over. As you keep holding the button, the next snap starts recording automatically.

 When you think itâs complete, at the bottom of the screen you can see the snaps appearing.

 The ones you wish to keep must be saved and the rest can be dragged in order to delete.

 Finally, you may edit the snaps and add effects like you do with any usual snap at the same time.
