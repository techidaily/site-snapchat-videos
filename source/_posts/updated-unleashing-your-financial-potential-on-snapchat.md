![snapchat app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/snapchat-app.jpg)

In this step-by-step guide, we'll walk you through exactly **how to make money on Snapchat**; so whether you're looking to make a little extra cash on the side or want to start a full-fledged Snapchat marketing career, this article is for you!

## Part 1\. Snapchat Overview

There is a saying goes: _Know the weather, know the terrain, and your victory will be complete._ Before we look into the detailed guidance in [Part 2](#%5FMethods%5FTo%5FMake), we should know more about Snapchat.

Snapchat is a photo messaging app developed on September 16, 2011, by Bobby Murphy,Reggie Brown, and Evan Spiegel while they were studying at Stanford University.

With Snapchat, you can take photos, record videos, add text and drawings, and send them to a controlled list of recipients. These sent MMS are known as "Snaps," and you can set a time limit on how long recipients can view them (a maximum of 24 hours, after which they will be automatically deleted).

Since its inception, Snapchat has evolved to include a wider range of features, including live video chat, story sharing, and lenses (augmented reality filters). Each of these functions is discussed below in detail:

* **Chat:** A messaging functionality you can use to communicate with your friends and family, share snaps, send stickers, or make a video/audio call.
* **Stories:** With this feature, you can add a compilation of images or videos for public viewing - available for 24 hours and then automatically disappear.
* **Live Stories:** There are stories of other users from a specific location or event that disappear after 24 hours.
* **Lenses:** These AR filters can be used to add fun effects to your pictures and post them as your stories or send them to someone.

![snapchat lens](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/snapchat-lens.jpg)

* **Filters:** Unlike lenses, they are static photo [overlays/effects](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that you can apply to your pictures to make them more captivating.
* **Snap Map:** This functionality lets you share your location with your friends. On the map, you will appear as a Bitmoji for them.
* **Snapchat Spotlight:** This is a TikTok-like feature helping many Snapchat users to make money. You can submit your best videos with a chance of earning a share of up to $1 million/day, depending on the number of views.

## Part 2\. Methods To Make Money On Snapchat

Snapchat's focus on short, time-limited content (your snaps/stories stay only for 24 hours) encourages more personalized sharing and contrasts more substantial relationships between brands and customers.

So, how to make money on Snapchat?

Keep reading to find out!

### Method 1: Creating Viral Video

When you submit your videos to Spotlight, Snapchat uses an algorithm to personalize the content to its viewers based on their interests by looking at factors such as how many times they watch a video, the number of skips, shares, and likes.

Thus, if your videos get more viewers and become viral, you will start earning money real quick. With that being said, let's understand with a report to see how you can begin making millions with your viral videos on Snapchat.

[Cam Casey](https://biographydaily.com/2022/07/27/cam-casey/), 19 years old TikTok star, decided to post his science experiment involving the explosion of a Coca-Cola bottle on Snapchat. His video went viral on Spotlight, and within two weeks, he became the top performer and earned hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Here is one example video about an experiment of Coke bottle:

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXs0a7BoWxs>

Casey is just one example of how Snapchat's new feature is helping people earn money, and you can be a part of it, too, by following some simple guidelines for posting Snapchat videos. A few of these suggestions are:

* Post up to 60 seconds long videos.
* Add at least one hashtag.
* Make content that is appropriate for a 30+ audience.
* Avoid [forbidden content](https://support.snapchat.com/en-US/a/spotlight-guidelines).
* Do not use sponsored or promotional content.

You might be thinking, "how can you edit your videos to enhance them and make them go viral?"

Well, you can use [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) \- a user-friendly mobile editor that can help you with all your editing tasks on the go.

### Method 2: Create Snapchat Ads On Your Story Or Ad Revenue Sharing

Snapchat has a more extensive user base and reaches almost 75% of all 13-47 old in the US, making it a great advertising channel.

There are two ways to earn money through ads:

**Get Paid to Advertise On Your Stories**

You can get paid to advertise content on your stories or Spotlight and get paid by the businesses.

For example, a famous content creator on Snapchat, Shaun McBride, collaborated with Disney to advertise the Frozen movie on his stories. However, for this method, you must have a solid follower base to be an [influencer](https://influencermarketinghub.com/what-is-an-influencer/) for any brand out there.

![influencer marketing on snapchat](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/influencer-marketing-on-snapchat.jpg)

**Create Snapchat Ads For Businesses**

Ads are one of the commercial modes of Snapchat. While most business owners are unaware of Snapchat or how to use it to promote their products and services, you can grab this opportunity to earn more.

With creative and interactive ads, you can catch users' attention and advertise other businesses to earn some extra cash in a short time.

Some ads formats offered by Snapchats are:

* Story ads (a series of ads).
* Collection ads (a series of products).
* Filters (artistic overlays).
* Commercials (up to three minutes long).
* Single image or video ads.
* Lenses (interaction with augmented reality).

Besides creating ads, you can also help businesses create AR filters and stickers to attract the masses. For instance, Sephora created an AR game lens to advertise their make-up products, as can be seen in the video:

Similarly, Domino's created a non-skippable ad campaign, "New Bigger Better," in Europe and reached more than 800,000 Norwegian Snapchat users.

![dominos snapchat ad](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/dominos-snapchat-ad.jpg)

### Method 3: Promote Your Own Products Or Services To Increase Sales

Aside from promoting other businesses, you can also promote your own products and services on Snapchat. You can share a clickable link or a downloadable asset of your product or service with your followers and friends.

One limitation here is that you must have a larger number of Snapchat friends to generate the desired revenue.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Avoid being too commercial. The audience's feeling is the most important thing to consider here.

### Method 4: Refer Other Products (Affiliate Marketing)

While Snapchat provides influencers with an opportunity to create sponsored content that showcases a brand or product to their followers, you can also use affiliate marketing, in which you receive a commission for promoting someone else's products or services using a link or promo code.

Try to create content that is creative, engaging, and captivating for affiliate marketing. This will definitely help you get user attention and generate more money via your provided links.

### Method 5\. Utilize Geofilter

Geofilters are a fun way to add creative flair to your snaps! These filters can be customized with personalized messages or designs for a specific event, new store openings, or grabbing users' attention and are available only at specific locations.

There are two types of Geofilers:

* **On-demand Geofilters:** These are paid ad filters created by businesses. For instance, Starbucks used a fall-themed geofilter for users near a Starbucks.

![geo filter by starbucks](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/geo-filter-by-starbucks.jpg)

* **Community Geofilters:** These are free-to-create filters that must be approved by Snapchat and can be created for special events or landmarks.

![geo filter when visitinf grand canyon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/geo-filter-when-visitinf-grand-canyon.jpg)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Make sure the location is intriguing to users while establishing a Geofilter.

### Method 6: Use Sponsored Lenses

Sponsored lenses are AR filters you can create on Snapchat to promote your business by sharing them with your targeted audience.

When you produce a campaign using sponsored lenses, the platform will guarantee that certain users will use the lens, resulting in huge revenue in return.

For instance, to accelerate their app's user growth, UK's famous Starling bank used an AR lens in 2019 to grab the viewer's attention. As a result, they received a 61% lower cost-per-install than their other campaign.

Similarly, BACARDÍ produced a lens with the summer theme to enhance their brand awareness and drive more sales. In their ten days campaign, they reached over 2.5 M Snapchatters and increased the purchase intent of BACARDÍ products.

### Method 7\. Get Featured On The Snapchat Spotlight

Snapchat Spotlight is a new feature highlighting the best content from Snapchat creators. Every day, the platform curates a selection of videos from creators worldwide and puts them in the Spotlight for the viewers.

If you can create awesome content, this will help you expand your exposure instead of generating profits directly. To use the Spotlight, create a snap, add music or voiceover, and click the **"Send >Spotlight"** option.

### Method 8: Use Story Ads

Story Ads let you expand your following base, increase your brand awareness, and get more customers around the globe by displaying ads in the Discovery feed on Snapchat. So, you must put your efforts into creating great story ads for maximum exposure.

## How to Send a Snap from Memories/Camera Roll as a Snap

Are you tired of sending your live selfies as snaps to your friends? In this section, you can learn **how to send snaps from the camera roll** without capturing a live snap. For this, we will explain some manual methods as well as some reliable apps in a detailed manner.

### Method 1: Using a Snapchat Filter

Snapchat allows you to apply its filters on any of your camera roll's pictures. By selecting a particular photo or video from your memories or snap, you can instantly add a filter to them. Afterward, you can send the filtered image to your friends as a regular snap. However, this solution has a significant drawback that you must know. The limitation is that the receiver of the snap would be able to see that the sent picture is from the camera roll.

Step1 Open your Snapchat and swipe up to open the 'Memories'. Go to your Camera Roll and select any particular picture from there.

![access camera roll tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/send-snaps-from-camera-roll-1.jpg)

Step2 After choosing a particular photo, tap on the "**Edit**" icon at the bottom left corner. You can apply filters to the photo by swiping from right to left. Keep swiping until you can find your preferred filter.

![tap on edit option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/send-snaps-from-camera-roll-2.jpg)

Step1 Once you have applied the filter to the photo, touch on the "Send To" button. Choose any Snapchat friend to whom you want to send the picture. Next, hit the "Send" icon again to send the photo successfully.

![tap on send to button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/send-snaps-from-camera-roll-3.jpg)

### Method 2: Using a Sticker

If you want to make your camera roll picture funny and entertaining, you can add stickers to it. Through Snapchat, you can make your customized sticker of any interesting face or object. Moreover, Snapchat also offers a huge variety of built-in stickers. If you don't want to create a customized sticker, you can easily add the built-in sticker with a single tap.

Step1 Once you have opened your Snapchat, go to Memories. From there, you can access and select any picture from the Camera Roll.

![choose camera roll option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/send-snaps-from-camera-roll-4.jpg)

Step2 After selecting a specific picture from Camera Roll, tap on the "Pencil" icon at the bottom left corner to edit the photo. Afterward, select the "Scissor" icon from the right section. Using the Snapchat Scissor, you can create a sticker of any face or object you find interesting. Just select any area of the photo using your finger.

## How to Send a Snap from Memories/Camera Roll as a Snap

Are you tired of sending your live selfies as snaps to your friends? In this section, you can learn **how to send snaps from the camera roll** without capturing a live snap. For this, we will explain some manual methods as well as some reliable apps in a detailed manner.

### Method 1: Using a Snapchat Filter

Snapchat allows you to apply its filters on any of your camera roll's pictures. By selecting a particular photo or video from your memories or snap, you can instantly add a filter to them. Afterward, you can send the filtered image to your friends as a regular snap. However, this solution has a significant drawback that you must know. The limitation is that the receiver of the snap would be able to see that the sent picture is from the camera roll.

Step1 Open your Snapchat and swipe up to open the 'Memories'. Go to your Camera Roll and select any particular picture from there.

![access camera roll tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/send-snaps-from-camera-roll-1.jpg)

Step2 After choosing a particular photo, tap on the "**Edit**" icon at the bottom left corner. You can apply filters to the photo by swiping from right to left. Keep swiping until you can find your preferred filter.

![tap on edit option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/send-snaps-from-camera-roll-2.jpg)

Step1 Once you have applied the filter to the photo, touch on the "Send To" button. Choose any Snapchat friend to whom you want to send the picture. Next, hit the "Send" icon again to send the photo successfully.

![tap on send to button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/send-snaps-from-camera-roll-3.jpg)

### Method 2: Using a Sticker

If you want to make your camera roll picture funny and entertaining, you can add stickers to it. Through Snapchat, you can make your customized sticker of any interesting face or object. Moreover, Snapchat also offers a huge variety of built-in stickers. If you don't want to create a customized sticker, you can easily add the built-in sticker with a single tap.

Step1 Once you have opened your Snapchat, go to Memories. From there, you can access and select any picture from the Camera Roll.

![choose camera roll option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/send-snaps-from-camera-roll-4.jpg)

Step2 After selecting a specific picture from Camera Roll, tap on the "Pencil" icon at the bottom left corner to edit the photo. Afterward, select the "Scissor" icon from the right section. Using the Snapchat Scissor, you can create a sticker of any face or object you find interesting. Just select any area of the photo using your finger.

![create your sticker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/send-snaps-from-camera-roll-5.jpg)

Step3 Now close the picture opened for creating the sticker. Once done, take a snap from your Snapchat to proceed. Now from the right section, tap on the "Sticker" icon. Here, you can choose the built-in stickers easily. Or you can navigate to the "Scissor" icon to select your created sticker.

![access the created stickers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/send-snaps-from-camera-roll-6.jpg)

Step4 Once done with adding and adjusting the sticker, hit the "Send To" button. Choose your preferred contact and tap on the "Send" icon again.

### Method 3: Using the LMK App

Another efficient way to send a camera roll picture as a regular snap is by using a third-party app. LMK is a reliable social media platform that enables you to communicate with friends having similar interests. You can craft your profile by adding your interests and hobbies.

It helps people to create a safe and healthy community for enhanced communication. In this solution, we will guide you on **how to send** **snaps from the camera roll** using the LMK app. Through this app, you can send snaps to your friends without mentioning the camera roll.

Step1 Open your Snapchat either from your Android or iOS device. Proceed to the Memories section and select Camera Roll. Here, tap on any picture that you want to send.

![choose picture from camera roll](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/send-snaps-from-camera-roll-8.jpg)

Step2 Now hit the "Arrow" button to share the selected snap. From the displayed options, tap on the "Download" icon to save the picture on your device gallery.

![download the selected photo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/send-snaps-from-camera-roll-9.jpg)

Step3 Now head to your Play Store or App Store according to the OS of your mobile device. From there, download the LMK app. After its complete installation, open this app using your Snapchat login.

![download and install lmk app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/send-snaps-from-camera-roll-10.jpg)

Step4 On the LMK app, tap on the "Plus" icon to proceed. Afterward, tap on "Post" and hit the "Camera" icon from the bottom left side. Now choose the photo that you have recently saved in your gallery.

![tap on camera icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/send-snaps-from-camera-roll-11.jpg)

Step5 After choosing the photo from the gallery, tap "Post to Snapchat." By doing so, you will be redirected to your Snapchat. From your image, remove the added stickers of the LMK app. You can drag the sticker to the trash bin icon. Afterward, tap on the "Paper Clip" icon to remove the added attachment.

![remove the sticker and link](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/send-snaps-from-camera-roll-12.jpg)

Step6 Once done with removing the sticker and attached link, hit the "Send" button. Now choose a Snapchat contact and hit the "Send" button.

### Method 4: Casper APK for Android

Casper is an excellent alternative for Snapchat users. Using this app, you can instantly add stickers and filters to the captured snaps. You can also save and forward snaps using this app to other platforms. However, Casper is not available on the Play Store. You can download the [Casper APK](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/casper-io/casper/) from your web browser easily.

![open manage apps settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/send-snaps-from-camera-roll-14.jpg)

Step2 Once done, locate the "Google Chrome" option and turn on the toggle of "Install from unknown sources."

![enable install unknown apps toggle](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/send-snaps-from-camera-roll-15.jpg)

Once you are done with installing Casper APK, you can take help from the following steps:

Step1 Sign out from your Snapchat account to initiate. Open Casper and sign into your Snapchat account.

Step2 Hit the "Plus" icon and tap on "Choose from Gallery." After selecting a picture from your phone's gallery, press the "Send" button.

Step3 Choose your preferred contact to whom you want to send the picture. For confirmation, tap on the "Send" button again.
