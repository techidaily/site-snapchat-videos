## Troubleshooting Tips: When Someone Hide Their Snapchat Stories from You

**Can You Hide Someone on Snapchat Without Them Knowing?**

If you wish to hide someone but in a way that they do not find out, try the new muting function. This allows you to mute certain friends without them realizing the same.
