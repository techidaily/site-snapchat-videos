Trim out portions that are unnecessary, add in background music, color corrections. You can double click on a clip that you add to the timeline of Filmora. The video then enters the editing panel and all edits are easy to do here.

#### 2.Picture-In-Picture

To make funny videos you could put in several video clips in a frame. This helps tell different threads of a storyline. With Filmora it is easy to achieve such an effect. You simply need to drag and then drop a video or an overlay image. Do so above a background video. You can then adjust the duration of the overlay clip to match the background video. It is also possible to choose a template and apply it to your video with a single click. You can then drag a funny image or photo to the timeline and customize the position.

#### 3.Record Voiceover

No funny video is complete without a strange and funny voice narrating the incidents. It is easy to replace audio as well as record voiceover for your Snapchat video using Filmora. All you need to do is click on the record button which captures voice recording in good quality. You can even change your voice or playing speed. Additionally, you can also remove or mute the original audio track and replace the same with a new recording.

#### 4.Apply Different Effects

There are several templates included with Filmora. It can turn video clips and common photos into exciting and funny videos. You can add effects like a laugh, scream, fire, and snow with simple drag and drop gestures.
