In this post, Iâm going to let you know how to add music to a Snapchat video without any hassle. Letâs get it started and level-up your Snapchat game!

While it doesnât include all sorts of tracks, you can find most of the popular songs so that you can easily add music to a Snapchat video and make it interesting.

Once the other person would view your snap, they can hear the music playing in the background. If they want to listen to it or know more about the song, then they can just tap on its sticker on your snap.

* **Why canât I add music to my Snapchat videos?**

Well, there could be two possible reasons for this â you might be using an old version of Snapchat or the feature might not be available in your region yet. To fix this, you can just go to the Snapchat page on the App/Play Store and tap on the âUpdateâ button. Furthermore, if the Sound feature has not been rolled out to your region, then you can just wait for a while.

As you can see, it is pretty easy to learn how to add music to a Snapchat video like a pro.
