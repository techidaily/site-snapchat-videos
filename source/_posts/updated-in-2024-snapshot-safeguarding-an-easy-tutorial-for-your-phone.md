## Part 1: How to Save Snapchats without them knowing

 You want to save a friendâ€™s Snaps, but Snapchat immediately alerts them of the screen shot taken. Hence, it is not possible to save otherâ€™s pictures or videos in Snapchat in incognito mode. You donâ€™t need apps to save Snapchat to your phone. There is hardly a feasible way to do so without the sendersâ€™ knowledge. In such a situation, you can try out the following option â€“ saving Snaps in flight mode.

 Here are the steps

1. First of all, launch the Snapchat app on your mobile phone and leave it open. Go to your phoneâ€™s â€˜Settingsâ€™ (Android/iPhone) and toggle on the â€˜Airplane/Flightâ€™ mode. Airplane/Flight mode disables all the wireless connections, be it network signals or internet related services for your device (Wi-Fi as well as cellular).

![snapchat save without knowing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snapchat-save-without-knowing.JPG)

2. Browse the Snapchat inbox and view the desired Snap that you wish to save, and quickly take a screenshot. Make sure to be quick enough and do it before the Snap expires.
3. Now, logout from your Snapchat account right after taking the screenshot. You need to follow the logout process according to your device specific settings. Being in â€˜Airplane/Flightâ€™ mode you canâ€™t logout, but click the logout option anyway (this is vital!).

![snapchat log out](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snapchat-log-out.JPG)

4. Here, you need to close the Snapchat app on your mobile phone by swiping out the Snapchat app (up/sideways depending on Android/iPhone) from your deviceâ€™s force quit screen.
5. Toggle off the â€˜Airplane/Flightâ€™ mode and wait until your phone connects to the Wi-Fi or mobile network. Now, launch the Snapchat app again and login with the same credentials. The Snaps you have taken screenshots of will still appear as unopened on the storyboard and your friend will have no clue about the Snap being screenshot.

## Part 2: How to save Snapchat videos on Mac

 After learning to take screenshots of Snaps using the â€˜Airplaneâ€™ mode, how about saving Snapchat videos on your Mac computer? Yes, you can easily save Snapchat videos using your iPhone and Mac computer. The process involves recording your iPhoneâ€™s screen through your Mac as a movie and then saving it. Here is how to do it

1. Take and connect your iPhone and Mac computer using a lightning cable. Make sure that they are pre-synced. Now, launch QuickTime Player on your computer and then tap â€˜Fileâ€™ in the finder menu, then â€˜New Movie Recordingâ€™.

![snapchat quicktime](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snapchat-quiktime.JPG)

2. This will make your Macâ€™s camera act as the primary camera/recording device. To turn the iPhone as the recording device, go to the QuickTime screen and tap the â€˜downward arrowâ€™ button adjacent to the record button. The iPhone will be available under both the Camera and Microphone section, choose it for both the options.

## Part 1: How to Save Snapchats without them knowing

 You want to save a friendâ€™s Snaps, but Snapchat immediately alerts them of the screen shot taken. Hence, it is not possible to save otherâ€™s pictures or videos in Snapchat in incognito mode. You donâ€™t need apps to save Snapchat to your phone. There is hardly a feasible way to do so without the sendersâ€™ knowledge. In such a situation, you can try out the following option â€“ saving Snaps in flight mode.

 Here are the steps

1. First of all, launch the Snapchat app on your mobile phone and leave it open. Go to your phoneâ€™s â€˜Settingsâ€™ (Android/iPhone) and toggle on the â€˜Airplane/Flightâ€™ mode. Airplane/Flight mode disables all the wireless connections, be it network signals or internet related services for your device (Wi-Fi as well as cellular).

![snapchat save without knowing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snapchat-save-without-knowing.JPG)

2. Browse the Snapchat inbox and view the desired Snap that you wish to save, and quickly take a screenshot. Make sure to be quick enough and do it before the Snap expires.
3. Now, logout from your Snapchat account right after taking the screenshot. You need to follow the logout process according to your device specific settings. Being in â€˜Airplane/Flightâ€™ mode you canâ€™t logout, but click the logout option anyway (this is vital!).

![snapchat log out](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snapchat-log-out.JPG)

4. Here, you need to close the Snapchat app on your mobile phone by swiping out the Snapchat app (up/sideways depending on Android/iPhone) from your deviceâ€™s force quit screen.
5. Toggle off the â€˜Airplane/Flightâ€™ mode and wait until your phone connects to the Wi-Fi or mobile network. Now, launch the Snapchat app again and login with the same credentials. The Snaps you have taken screenshots of will still appear as unopened on the storyboard and your friend will have no clue about the Snap being screenshot.

## Part 2: How to save Snapchat videos on Mac

 After learning to take screenshots of Snaps using the â€˜Airplaneâ€™ mode, how about saving Snapchat videos on your Mac computer? Yes, you can easily save Snapchat videos using your iPhone and Mac computer. The process involves recording your iPhoneâ€™s screen through your Mac as a movie and then saving it. Here is how to do it
