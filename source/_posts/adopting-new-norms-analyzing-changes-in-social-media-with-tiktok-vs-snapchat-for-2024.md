Businesses, large and small, are continuously hunting for social media platforms, where they can promote their products and services, and more than that, build up an enormous community around them. While Facebook and Instagram have long been in the scene, new ones like TikTok and Snapchat are starting to pop up. If you are operating your business in the 21st century and still have not developed your presence in them, then, believe it or not, you are truly missing out on a whole lot of opportunities. But the million-dollar question is – what’s the difference between the two marketing channels from the perspective of an influencer and a marketer? The article here draws out the dissimilarities between the two for the brands to identify the most fitting potential marketing channel to promote themselves.

## Basic Comparison Between TikTok and Snapchat

Before digging into the dissimilarities between the two apps, don’t you think it’s better to draw insight into them individually? The section here introduces both TikTok and Snapchat individually, highlighting interesting facts that might help you draw out the basic differences between the two social media networks.

**TikTok Fundamentals**

A very popular video-sharing app, launched by the Chinese multinational internet technology company ByteDance in 2017\. By the end of 2018, it took the world by storm, especially in the USA. At the end of 2019, it generated 1.5 billion downloads from all around the world.

As per advertising is concerned, it’s mostly in the form of branded filters, takeovers, top view ads, hashtag challenges, in-feed native video ads, and influencer brand partnerships.

**Snapchat Fundamentals**

A mobile messaging app ideal for sharing both visual, and textual content, including videos, photos and texts. Unlike TikTok, it’s relatively old and was launched back in the year 2011.

Contrary to TikTok, Snapchat does not just allow users to keep pace with the current trend but also connect with buddies over Stories and other ephemeral content. It’s empowering both users and brands with abilities to showcase creativity through 3D environment interactions, object scanning, and try-on effects.

Regarding its target audience, they are mostly the millennials, 218 million of whom fall into the list of active users. From a marketing perspective, it permits brands to promote themselves through shoppable ads, branded filters, personalized targeting, AR lenses, and Snap Ad.

## TikTok vs. Snapchat: What Influencers Need to Know

Wondering what’s an Influencer? Well, it’s someone you hire to promote your organization’s products when you fail to reach out to a wider audience. The person entrusted with the responsibilities of marketing your brand will ensure the flooding in of more followers for greater exposure. It’s a concept similar to social media influencers that you would find in both TikTok and Snapchat.

From the stance of an Influencer, here are 5 differences between the two apps.

* **Core Features**

Influencers tend to look for features for creating a gripping visual content. TikTok ushers a quite a few of them, including video capture, filter effects, sound library, impressive editing tools, creation prompts and a ‘For You’ page, where the discovery feed based on algorithm is available.

On the contrary, Snapchat features similar such tools but with the only difference being in the count. You will find here more options besides video capture and editing tools, these being text and video chat, AR Lenses, Story creation, Discover tab, image capture, and Snap Maps.

* **Type of Users**

While in TikTok, you will mostly find the celebrities, renowned brands and content creators to flood the social media platform; in Snapchat, the crowd mostly comprises of publishers.

* **Demographic**

Mostly Gen-Z occupies the crowd in TikTok, majority of whom belong to the age group 18-24\. However, Snapchat is mostly dominated by millennials.

* **Active Users**

The relatively new app of TikTok happens to attract fewer active users, accounting 41 million globally, whereas Snapchat enjoys the presence of 218 million population daily.

* **Downloads**

Probably because TikTok is new to people that 738 million of them have downloaded the app from all around the world in the year 2019 itself. However, Snapchat recorded 75 million globally in the same year.

An influencer observes all the above statistics before choosing to go for the preferred social media network.

## TikTok vs. Snapchat: What Marketers Should Know

Sometimes, marketers seem to put all their energy into an app without realizing the level of effectiveness it would generate. The same holds for TikTok and Snapchat. So, it’s always wise to walk through the pros and cons of both, seek out the contrasting points from the perspective of certain key indicators and then decide. If you are here wondering where to start your advertising campaign from, go through the points below to make an informed decision.

* **Content Marketing**

Go for the TikTok app, if you are targeting the Gen-Z population and currently undergoing budget constraints. With inclusions of hashtags and keywords, you can optimize the video content, attract your target audience, and build a community around you. However, it’s not a very promising app for directing traffic to your website as the social media network allows only a few brands to share the link of their created videos in the website content.

On the contrary, Snapchat is the most favorable app among brands seeking a platform to launch short, bite-sized videos to promote a newly-launched product and gain admiration from both Gen-Z and millennials. And the best thing? You can always draw online traffic to your website through them and generate greater conversions.

* **Marketing Opportunities**

Lucrative opportunities await the small businesses investing their time and energy in TikTok because the platform being relatively new, sets limited norms on what makes content engaging and what fails to achieve it. Moreover, it’s a great spot to test the waters before going widespread with your products over other social media networks.

Snapchat, on the contrary, is most suitable for mid-sized and large-scale companies because it lacks the perspective of free content creation. However, plenty of advertising alternatives are floating up for brands to leverage, which is why most of the companies are now investing more in it than other advertising channels. Moreover, it enables all business users to share links of created content on websites that TikTok fails to cover.

Put simply, Snapchat promises more marketing opportunities to businesses that have ample funds whereas TikTok favors those who are pressed for money. But, speaking of brand-friendliness, the latter welcomes more experiments than prior.

* **User Base & Behavior**

Prior to launching a promotional campaign, don’t you think it’s prudent to grab an idea about the user base in each app? Of course, otherwise, you will be landing with the wrong audience and gradually fail to generate enough conversions.

Believe it or not, but reports claim that Snapchat is home to 210 million active users daily, whereas TikTok to 800 million every month. Though both the apps attract millennials and Gen-Z users, launching your ad campaign in the prior will mean more exposure of your products to a vast audience, 61% of whom are female. However, if you are focusing more on men, TikTok will a great platform to start with because 56% of the global male audience is its active users.

**What to Choose?**

Thankfully, we now have an answer to the most sought-after debate of TikTok vs. Snapchat! If you are seeking a platform that’s more stable and widely used up by the general population, Snapchat should be your go-to app. In the past, it has offered better ROI (Return on Investment) to brands choosing to reach out to their target audience through it. And, with ad offerings on the rise here, it’s certainly more approachable to brands. But, let’s not disregard TikTok because it’s in the nascent stage. Let’s not forget that it’s a great platform to run experiments and observe the reactions of Gen-Z before reaching out to millennials. The ball is in your court now. Go for whatever seems to be the most fitting for your business and look beyond the traditional social media networks for a change to stay afloat in the market.

Contrary to TikTok, Snapchat does not just allow users to keep pace with the current trend but also connect with buddies over Stories and other ephemeral content. It’s empowering both users and brands with abilities to showcase creativity through 3D environment interactions, object scanning, and try-on effects.

Regarding its target audience, they are mostly the millennials, 218 million of whom fall into the list of active users. From a marketing perspective, it permits brands to promote themselves through shoppable ads, branded filters, personalized targeting, AR lenses, and Snap Ad.

## TikTok vs. Snapchat: What Influencers Need to Know

Wondering what’s an Influencer? Well, it’s someone you hire to promote your organization’s products when you fail to reach out to a wider audience. The person entrusted with the responsibilities of marketing your brand will ensure the flooding in of more followers for greater exposure. It’s a concept similar to social media influencers that you would find in both TikTok and Snapchat.

From the stance of an Influencer, here are 5 differences between the two apps.

* **Core Features**

Influencers tend to look for features for creating a gripping visual content. TikTok ushers a quite a few of them, including video capture, filter effects, sound library, impressive editing tools, creation prompts and a ‘For You’ page, where the discovery feed based on algorithm is available.

On the contrary, Snapchat features similar such tools but with the only difference being in the count. You will find here more options besides video capture and editing tools, these being text and video chat, AR Lenses, Story creation, Discover tab, image capture, and Snap Maps.

* **Type of Users**

While in TikTok, you will mostly find the celebrities, renowned brands and content creators to flood the social media platform; in Snapchat, the crowd mostly comprises of publishers.

* **Demographic**

Mostly Gen-Z occupies the crowd in TikTok, majority of whom belong to the age group 18-24\. However, Snapchat is mostly dominated by millennials.

* **Active Users**

The relatively new app of TikTok happens to attract fewer active users, accounting 41 million globally, whereas Snapchat enjoys the presence of 218 million population daily.

* **Downloads**

Probably because TikTok is new to people that 738 million of them have downloaded the app from all around the world in the year 2019 itself. However, Snapchat recorded 75 million globally in the same year.

An influencer observes all the above statistics before choosing to go for the preferred social media network.

## TikTok vs. Snapchat: What Marketers Should Know

Sometimes, marketers seem to put all their energy into an app without realizing the level of effectiveness it would generate. The same holds for TikTok and Snapchat. So, it’s always wise to walk through the pros and cons of both, seek out the contrasting points from the perspective of certain key indicators and then decide. If you are here wondering where to start your advertising campaign from, go through the points below to make an informed decision.

* **Content Marketing**

Go for the TikTok app, if you are targeting the Gen-Z population and currently undergoing budget constraints. With inclusions of hashtags and keywords, you can optimize the video content, attract your target audience, and build a community around you. However, it’s not a very promising app for directing traffic to your website as the social media network allows only a few brands to share the link of their created videos in the website content.

On the contrary, Snapchat is the most favorable app among brands seeking a platform to launch short, bite-sized videos to promote a newly-launched product and gain admiration from both Gen-Z and millennials. And the best thing? You can always draw online traffic to your website through them and generate greater conversions.

* **Marketing Opportunities**

Lucrative opportunities await the small businesses investing their time and energy in TikTok because the platform being relatively new, sets limited norms on what makes content engaging and what fails to achieve it. Moreover, it’s a great spot to test the waters before going widespread with your products over other social media networks.

Snapchat, on the contrary, is most suitable for mid-sized and large-scale companies because it lacks the perspective of free content creation. However, plenty of advertising alternatives are floating up for brands to leverage, which is why most of the companies are now investing more in it than other advertising channels. Moreover, it enables all business users to share links of created content on websites that TikTok fails to cover.

Put simply, Snapchat promises more marketing opportunities to businesses that have ample funds whereas TikTok favors those who are pressed for money. But, speaking of brand-friendliness, the latter welcomes more experiments than prior.

* **User Base & Behavior**

Prior to launching a promotional campaign, don’t you think it’s prudent to grab an idea about the user base in each app? Of course, otherwise, you will be landing with the wrong audience and gradually fail to generate enough conversions.

Believe it or not, but reports claim that Snapchat is home to 210 million active users daily, whereas TikTok to 800 million every month. Though both the apps attract millennials and Gen-Z users, launching your ad campaign in the prior will mean more exposure of your products to a vast audience, 61% of whom are female. However, if you are focusing more on men, TikTok will a great platform to start with because 56% of the global male audience is its active users.

**What to Choose?**

Thankfully, we now have an answer to the most sought-after debate of TikTok vs. Snapchat! If you are seeking a platform that’s more stable and widely used up by the general population, Snapchat should be your go-to app. In the past, it has offered better ROI (Return on Investment) to brands choosing to reach out to their target audience through it. And, with ad offerings on the rise here, it’s certainly more approachable to brands. But, let’s not disregard TikTok because it’s in the nascent stage. Let’s not forget that it’s a great platform to run experiments and observe the reactions of Gen-Z before reaching out to millennials. The ball is in your court now. Go for whatever seems to be the most fitting for your business and look beyond the traditional social media networks for a change to stay afloat in the market.

If you are a regular Snapchat user, you may want to learn about the Snapchat lens and how it can help you. We will help you get started. Here is our step by step guide on how to make Snapchat lenses.

* [**Part1: Comparing Lens Studio and Creating Your Own Lens**](#part1)
* [**Part2: How to Use Lens Studio**](#part2)
* [**Part3: How to Create Snapchat Lenses Using Create Your Own Lens**](#part3)

## Part 1: Comparing Lens Studio and Creating Your Own Lens

The two programs that we are highlighting today are Lens Studio and Create Your Own Lens. These are both fantastic programs for creating your own Snapchat lens, but they do have slightly different uses. If you are the type of person who wants to design a professional Snapchat lens, you are going to prefer Lens Studio.

But if you are hoping to come up with something creative that you can share with your friends and family, then you may love Create Your Own Lens. It is a very easy program to use, and it offers a ton of features that you may be surprised to see.

#### Snapchat lenses is for fun

The beauty of Snapchat lenses is that you can now create your own environment, which you can use each time you are taking photos or videos. Sure, you can always use the filters that are already available in the application, but not everyone would find those enough.

If you want some customization, or you just want to mess around until you get the filter that makes sense for you, Snapchat lenses are the way to go.

![lens studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Lens-Studio.JPG)

#### Lens Studio is for business

Lens Studio is perfect for businesses that may want to create unique environments for their clients, or the times when they are releasing company Snapchat posts. Say the company is hosting an event. They may want a custom graphic for that event, which is used for all the pictures and videos posted to Snapchat about the event. Using Lens Studio lets them do that with ease.

Create Your Own Lens is great when you are going to a special event, birthday party or graduating, and you want a special graphic that comes up in all your snaps. It is very intuitive to use, and is available through the App Store as a download.

![lens studio snapchat](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/len-studio-snapchat.JPG)

## Part 2: How to Use Lens Studio

#### 1\. Download Lens Studio

The first step involves downloading Lens Studio, which you can do from your computer. It is compatible with both Windows and Mac computers, and will run on any semi-modern system. According to the Snapchat team, Lens Studio is similar to the program used by their AR teams to create lenses. That means you are getting similar functionality, but with an easier to manage interface.

#### 2\. Choose Templates Page

It is normal to feel a little overwhelmed the first time you try and use this program. But that is why the templates page is so great. You can select from templates depending on the type of lens that you are hoping to create. You can just use a template, or you can incorporate your own ideas to customize the template.

There is also a Lens Studio Overview guide that you can access online, which will help you get acquainted with the program’s various features and quirks.

![lens studio templates](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lens-studio-templates.JPG)

#### 3\. Use Studio Panels

Are you ready to create your own custom Snapchat lens? It is time to head over to Studio Panels on the application. This is the area where you can add your own 2D or 3D objects, and you can visualize how they would look as a Snapchat filter. You can add, remove, resize and drag objects to specific areas of the screen.

There are other tools accessible from the Resources panel. You can use these tools to ensure that your Snapchat lens is exactly as you want.

![lens studio panel](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lens-studio-panal.JPG)

#### 4\. Preview the Snapchat Lens You Create

The great thing about this application is that you can preview the lens before you send it out to your phone. When you are satisfied with the image on the preview, you can pair your phone with the application, and you will be able to send that Snapchat lens onto your phone through your Snapcode. It is that simple!

![preview lens studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/preview-snapchat.JPG)

## Part 3: How to Create Snapchat Lenses Using Create Your Own Lens

1. There are two ways that you can access the tool for creating fun Snapchat lenses. You can either visit the website snapchat.com/create, or you can go on the “filters and lenses” section on your iOS device. If you are using Snapchat on an Android device, you will only have the option for the website. But the feature is coming to the Android version of Snapchat very soon.
2. When you are in the application or on the website, you may start to look at the different templates for Snapchat lenses. Now you can add other items into the templates, such as photographs, text or graphics.

![create snapchat](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-snapchat.JPG)

It is all up to your imagination. You can create the perfect Snapchat lens, which you can then send into your Snapchat account through your Snapcode. Of course, if you are using your iOS device to create the lens, it is already linked to your account.

Another cool feature is how you can set the location for where the Snapchat lens is available. Say you are hosting a party. You can have the Snapchat lens available to everyone who uses Snapchat within a set square footage of your home. That is an amazing way to let everyone share social media pictures and photos of your party, through the lens you created.

## Conclusion

Creating Snapchat lenses has never been easier. Whether you are a business looking to add a custom lens, or you just want to create a fun lens for a graduation or party, there are tools that make the job very easy. Using these tools will allow you to create the perfect Snapchat lens for any occasion.

It is all up to your imagination. You can create the perfect Snapchat lens, which you can then send into your Snapchat account through your Snapcode. Of course, if you are using your iOS device to create the lens, it is already linked to your account.

Another cool feature is how you can set the location for where the Snapchat lens is available. Say you are hosting a party. You can have the Snapchat lens available to everyone who uses Snapchat within a set square footage of your home. That is an amazing way to let everyone share social media pictures and photos of your party, through the lens you created.

## Conclusion

Creating Snapchat lenses has never been easier. Whether you are a business looking to add a custom lens, or you just want to create a fun lens for a graduation or party, there are tools that make the job very easy. Using these tools will allow you to create the perfect Snapchat lens for any occasion.
