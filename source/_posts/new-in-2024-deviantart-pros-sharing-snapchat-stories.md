**Introduction**

Snapchat is a social media service that has several fun options for users to express themselves. The service has launched several innovative features over the years and one of their latest and popular tools is cameos. It is a fun way that one can express themselves, with their own faces plastered on comic characters or on bodies of animals and so forth.

1. **What is a Snapchat Cameo?**

If you have been seeing your friends add their faces to fun emojis, cartoons, and other figures, you could do that too with this fun feature on Snapchat. A cameo is an option that allows you to add your face to comic characters or animals or even create funny videos with them. You become a star of looping, short videos that you can send across to your friends. It is a great way to express your emotions in moments. Instead of messages, **Snapchat cameos** are an innovative way to say hello, express your feelings, and so forth. It is possible to customize captions and add them to the cameos that you create.

These are easy to add and send in chat messages since it is an option that occurs next to the stickers. It is available on the apps created for Android and iOS devices. You can choose from more than 150 cameos which makes it a great feature.

Indeed, who would not want to have cool means to express themselves, their opinions, or tell their close friends what they feel? Snapchat offers several unique ways of expressing yourself. While you could attach videos or memes that express what you feel, with a cameo you can make that even more personalized and unique. Add your face to cool videos, animations, or pics. What’s more, you can add text in different fonts and with interesting effects. It is nothing short of creating a video by yourself. That too can be easily done in a matter of seconds, while you are on chat with your friends or loved ones.

1. **How to Use Snapchat Cameo?**

There are easy ways to get started when using **Snapchat cameos**. All you need is to tap on the button provided, on the sticker bar. It involves taking a selfie or choosing a picture or a video that you already have on your phone or tablet. If a friend has set up the feature in their Snapchat and is chatting live, it is possible to co-star in it together.

Here are simple ways to get started:

* Start by choosing a contact on the Snap list with whom you wish to start a conversation or want to send a pic or video using this feature. You will find the functionality while you are texting and adding effects to the conversation. For this reason, the function appears in the borders of the keyboard you use.
* Once the chat page opens up, find the face icon next to the chat bar which shows above the keyboard. This leads to the emoji page along where you will find the **Snapchat cameos** option at the bottom.
* You will find the cameo icon at the bottom of this section. It looks like a face with a + sign on it. This will lead you to create the cameo video or pic.
* It starts by activating the selfie camera. It aligns the face on the camera with an outline in blue. It will instruct you to take the selfie picture.
* You will then get options for adding filters to the cameo of your face. This can consist of pictures you have in your gallery or a repository of images and cartoons that the app provides. You could also source images from the internet or videos to use for this purpose.
* Once the filters are applied and captions added, you are ready to send across the cameo to your selected contact. The **Snapchat cameos** you create get added to the chat option directly.
* It is also possible to create a two-person cameo, especially if the person’s pics are available on your gallery of images. You can also add text to make the pics more expressive.

1. **How to Fix Snapchat Cameo Not Showing up?**

Users of the Snapchat app can use cameo as one of the innovative new features that help them add their faces to funny videos, cartoons, and so forth. However, in certain instances, the cameos might not show up. In such cases you can fix such issues with the following steps:

#### 1.Smells fishy

This snap sticker is hilarious in its own way. It best suits a situation that sounds shady on your Snapchat. Maybe a stranger asked you to start a Snapchat streak with them? Or your buddies acting weird in their stories? Make use of this freaky funny Snapchat sticker when you smell something fishy.

#### 2.Whaaa eeh??

The perfect snap sticker that relates to our blank situation on a whole new level is this one. People find this sticker quite laughable when used in awkwardly witty cases. Don't get someone's waggish accent but also not wanna feel silly; use this sticker to your benefit.

#### 3.Spill the dirt

Hands down, one of the best Snapchat stickers of all time is this one. See that smile; that smile will tell you all. This quirky Snapchat sticker represents a gossip session you know will be lit before it is even spilled. Through this sticker in your buddy's Snapchat inbox to let them know you're all set to spill the dirt.

#### 4.To meme or not to meme

Mamma-Mia I love this sticker personally. This funny Snapchat sticker was made to represent a poor Shakespeare pun. You can use this sticker in your snaps to cover up after making a joke so terrible; your friends might throw you out of the window.

#### 5.You ma QUEEN

A funny yet adorable Snapchat sticker that represents most love situations perfectly is this one. A single text from your queen and your mind hops on to create romantic scenarios (that are probably never happening). But what can happen is that you can make your honeybunch feel special by sending them this cute snap sticker.

![Smile Snapchat Sticker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/smile-snapchat-sticker.jpg)

#### 6.It's all good

This ironic Snapchat sticker best represents a situation when you're trying to keep your head above water. Use this sticker on your snap to describe your condition when a social media friend inquires about you.

![All Good Sticker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/all-good-sticker.jpg)

#### 7.What the behavior dude

Get your Snapchat fam crack up your snap with this super funny Snapchat sticker. For me, it represents a ludicrous situation; most of us end up in daily. Like when you ask for a new shampoo bottle while showering, only to get back the same bottle filled with water.

![Behavior Snapchat Sticker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/behavior-snapchat-sticker.jpg)

#### 8.Your smug smile

The jerry in this Snapchat sticker portrays that one friend in every squad who considers himself the "smart soul." If you're that friend among your team, you will love to use this sticker to show your smug smile every time you put forward your smartness.

![Smug Smile Sticker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/smug-smile-sticker.jpg)

#### 9.No offense, but that was pathetic

That face you make when someone cracks a joke so LAME, you just can't take it. It looks like this Snapchat sticker was created to match our Yikes face. Take advantage of this funny Snapchat sticker and tell someone their joke was pretty pathetic without making them angry.

![Pathetic Snapchat Sticker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pathetic-snapchat-sticker.jpg)

#### 10\. I'm not crying; you're crying

One of the best Snapchat stickers, I believe. It comes from those adorable situations when you're overwhelmed and just can't control your tears (certainly the tears of joy). Imagine your friend sent you a "100 reasons why I love you" text, and it got you awestruck. You won't find a sticker better than this to shower your friend with.

![Crying Snapchat Sticker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/crying-snapchat-sticker.jpg)

Pro-tip: Dive into your Snapchat, snap a photo, add one of these hilarious snap stickers, draw over or customize the snap. And Voila, you just created a SNAPSTERPIECE.

## Part 2: How to Add Sticker to Snapchat

Are you new to Snapchat, or maybe you're just confused about how these funny Snapchat stickers will hinge up to your snaps? In any case, here's a quick step by step tutorial (with pictures) that you can follow to add some shine to your "too mainstream" snap stories.

#### 1.OPEN SNAPCHAT

Launch your Snapchat app and log in if you haven't already. This will bring you to a front camera view.

![Open Snapchat App](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/open-snapchat-app.jpg)

#### 2.SNAP A PICTURE

The large circular button in the middle bottom of the screen is the shutter used for snapping. Take a picture with your back camera, or you can toggle the camera button to take a cute selfie.

![Snap A Picture](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snap-a-picture.jpg)

#### 3.TAP THE STICKER ICON FROM THE TOOLBAR

As soon as you snap a picture, a toolbar with six tools will appear on the right corner of your screen. Tap the third icon that looks like a page with a turned-up corner to open the sticker page.

#### 4.CHOOSE A STICKER

Browse through the variety of stickers by swiping up or right till you choose one. Tap on the sticker to add it to your snap.
