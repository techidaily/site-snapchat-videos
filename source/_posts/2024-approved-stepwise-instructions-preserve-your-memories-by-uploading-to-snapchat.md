## Part 3: How to Check Your Backup Progress

To ensure a complete backup of your Memories on Snapchat, a stable Wi-Fi connection is mandatory. That's why make sure to connect your phone with a stable and strong internet connection. Moreover, if you have chosen multiple photos or videos from the Camera Roll, you can save them as a story on Snapchat. However, if you want to save individual images, you will need to make their backup separately in Memories. To check your backup progress on Snapchat, navigate to the following steps:

Step1 Once you have opened your Snapchat, tap on your Bitmoji icon. From there, proceed to the "Settings" by tapping on the gear icon.

#### Step 3: Wait for answering

 Their phone will start ringing if they have enabled Snapchat notifications. Enabling notification will also let them know that youâre calling even if they are not using the app that time. Or else, they can only get the call, while using Snapchat.

 There are 3 options to respond to a call.

1. If they click on âWatchâ option, they can see you, but you arenât allowed for so.
2. If they tap âJoinâ option, it means both of you can see and talk to each other. In case they select âIgnoreâ option, you will get a busy message.
3. If you tap the green camera icon the video becomes one way, where only you can see them, but they wonât see you.

 Note: By swiping the screen down, you can minimize the Snapchat video call.
