## Part 2: How To Recover Snapchat Photos/Videos From iPhone

Unlike Snapchat recovery on Android, there are no other ways than apps to recover Snapchat photos/videos on iPhone. The FonePaw iPhone Data Recovery software can be used to recover Snapchat photos. The steps to Snapchat recovery are-

   1. Download the free version of the FonePaw iPhone Data Recovery on the PC to connect your iPhone to it. Once the computer detects your iPhone, click on the Start Scan button in blue color. As soon as you click on it, the program starts scanning all your iPhone data.

   1. With the end of the scanning process, on the left-hand side of the screen, you can find the App Photos. Click on it and try searching the deleted Snapchat photos and videos. If you find the Snapchats, click on Recover for Snapchat recovery.
   2. If not, then, you may disconnect the iPhone from your PC to try other 2 modes of recovery that are Recover from iTunes backup file and Recover from the iCloud backup file. These two modes to recover Snapchat photos/videos also have trial versions so you can always give it a try.
