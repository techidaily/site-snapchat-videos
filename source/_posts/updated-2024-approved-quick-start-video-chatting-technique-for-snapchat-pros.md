## The Ultimate Checklist: Seamless Conversion of Phone Photos to Snapchat

Many people haven't backed up their camera roll to Snapchat due to the default settings. If you want to save each photo or video from your device on the Snapchat cloud, backing up the camera to the Memories is necessary. By doing so, you cannot lose important photos or videos from your phone.

If you change the default settings of the Memories created from the camera roll, Snapchat will automatically create a backup of your Memories. In this regard, this article will guide you on **how to back up the camera roll to Snapchat** in the easiest way.

## Part 1: Backing up automatically - Creating Snapchat Stories from your Camera Roll

If you don't want to alter the settings of your camera roll, this part will offer you an easy method. Through this method, you can create Snapchat stories from the camera roll directly. By doing so, you can instantly save the camera roll photos to your Snapchat without backing up. To make a Snapchat story from your camera roll, read the following instructions:

Step1 Open your Snapchat and swipe up from the bottom. Head to the Camera Roll section and select any photo.

![access camera roll](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/back-up-camera-roll-to-snapchat-1.jpg)

Step2 After selecting a particular photo or video, hit the "Arrow" icon. Afterward, tap on the "My Story" option to create a story. For confirmation, press the "Arrow" icon again. This will create a Snapchat story instantly from your Camera Roll.

## Part 2: How to Backup your Camera Roll to Snapchat without Creating Stories

In Snapchat, you can only save the camera roll videos having a maximum of 10-second length. It indicates that you cannot save the camera roll videos which exceed the 10-second limit. Furthermore, there are various ways that enable you to make a Camera Roll backup on Snapchat. In this part, we will guide you on how to save a Camera roll photo or video on Snapchat without creating a story. Also, these steps are applicable on both Android and iOS devices:

Step1 After opening your Snapchat app, open your Memories by swiping up. Proceed to your "Camera Roll" section and long-press on any picture. This will let you select any photo or video on your Camera Roll.

## Part 3: How to Check Your Backup Progress

To ensure a complete backup of your Memories on Snapchat, a stable Wi-Fi connection is mandatory. That's why make sure to connect your phone with a stable and strong internet connection. Moreover, if you have chosen multiple photos or videos from the Camera Roll, you can save them as a story on Snapchat.

Step1 Once you have opened your Snapchat, tap on your Bitmoji icon. From there, proceed to the "Settings" by tapping on the gear icon.

![open snapchat settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/back-up-camera-roll-to-snapchat-5.jpg)
