## Part 1\. Choosing Creative Topics for Snapchat Video

On the top of that, we will start with coming up with creative ideas for your Snapchat videos. If you're struggling to develop **ideas to post on Snapchat**, don't worry - we've got you covered.

Below we've provided some tips for your Snapchat videos:

### Idea 1\. Conduct Interviews Via Snaps

If you are running your Snapchat like a YouTube channel, conducting interviews on Snapchat is a perfect way to get quick, candid responses from your interviewees. To make it more fun, captivating, and engaging, you can also use captivating Snaps to add a personal touch.

All you need is: set lighting and sound, a 10-second snap with a question on it, and the interviewee. Start by introducing the person in the frame, put the snap on the screen, and let the interviewee answer your question.

To make things interesting, add [filters](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), stickers, or [lenses](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to reflect the scenarios or your personality. In the outro, provide a snap to thank the interviewee and share their Snapcode to let people follow them, a call to action, a positive phrase like thanks for watching, or your other social media handles.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Idea 2\. Host A YouTube And Snapchat Q&A

Another great idea is to host a YouTube and Snapchat Q&A. You can film with a famous snap chatter or YouTuber and ask them a few questions. You can also ask your followers/audience to send their questions via text message or response to your stories. This will help you get your viewers involved with your content and increase engagement.

To make sure your snap Q&A goes off without a hitch, be sure to:

* Set up your Snapchat settings of **"Who Can Contact Me"** to **"Everyone"** for a while to allow for questions.
* During the session, try to acknowledge who asked the question.
* After the session, change the "**Who Can Contact Me"** setting back to **only friends** to avoid spam overload.

### Idea 1\. Create Title Cards For Longer Snapchat Stories

If you're creating a Snapchat story that is longer than the standard 10 seconds, you can use title cards to help keep your viewers engaged.

Title cards are simply images with the text you can insert into your story to help identify what's coming next. For example, if you're sharing a story about your company's history, you could use a title card at the beginning of each section to identify the different parts of the story.

For this, you can take a snap of a wall or perhaps block your camera to get a black screen and then paste your text on the picture. You can also play with the font size, style, or color to create engaging title cards.

One way to create shareable and fun content is by making full use of Snapchat's filters. For this, the app offers a ton of different filters to choose from, so you can really get creative while using them

However, you can only target an area between 20,000 and 5 million square feet. Moreover, they can only stay active for up to 30 days.

##### 2\. With AR/VR filters

We all love filters, don't we? Whether it's a dog filter or a flower crown, filters add a touch of fun and personality to our photos and videos. With the advent of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technology, filters are getting even more creative and immersive.

Snapchat's AR/VR filters are some of the most fun and innovative on the market, and they're constantly adding new ones to keep users engaged. You can also use these filters to create interactive content for your business.

For example, Dior created a Men Saddle Belt filter to promote its product and in turn, gained more sales, brand recognition as well as engagement.

![dior filter on snapchat](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/dior-filter-on-snapchat.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Idea 2\. Use Short Links

Since you cannot add clickable links to your snaps, using a shortened URL is an excellent approach to help people follow up on your links.

To get started, you need to find a URL shortener service such as [bitly.com](https://bitly.com/) and then begin sharing your shortened URLs with your Snapchat followers. You can add them to your snaps or post them in your story.

### Idea 3\. Sneak Peeks Of New Products

Giving your followers/customers a sneak peek of new products before they hit the shelves can excite them about your brand. This not only builds anticipation and excitement but also gives your fans a chance to be the first to know how and when to get their hands on your new products.

You can provide sneak peeks of new products on Snapchat in a number of ways. For instance, you can give short previews or teasers of products in your upcoming collection or first look at new products. You can even use Snapchat to give your fans a behind-the-scenes look at how your products are made.

Whatever approach you take, ensure that you're providing value to your audience. They should feel like they're getting something special by having a sneak peek of your new products.

### Idea 4\. Attach Your Username, Username URL, Or Snapchat Code

To get more audiences and followers on Snapchat, you can also try attaching your username, username URL, or Snapcode to your stories. These three approaches can help your customers find your account or add you as a friend on Snapchat.

To share your Snapchat username URL, open **Snapchat** and click your **Profile** icon. Tap on your **yellow Snapcode** to access more options. Tap **"Share My Profile Link"** and select the platform you want to share it with.

To share your Snapcode, simply let others scan the code via their phone's camera or tap **"Profile > Snapcode icon > Share Snapcode."**

### Idea 5\. Publish Your Snaps To Other Platforms

Do you want to get more eyes on your snaps on Snapchat? If so, you should consider publishing them on other platforms. Doing this can help you can reach a wider audience and get more people interested in your brand.

You can download your Snaps and repost them on other platforms like Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and more. To learn more, read: [How to Save Snapchat Videos with Apps on Android and Mac.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

### 2\. Ideas for Better Promotion on Snapchat

Here are some quick ideas to post better promotional content on Snapchat:

### Idea 1\. Run Snapchat Ads

As a business, you always want to look for new ways to reach your target audience. With Snapchat being the 12th most popular social media platform today, it's definitely worth considering running ads on Snapchat.

Let's look into benefits of running ads on Snapchat:

* To reach a younger audience that might not be on other platforms like Facebook or Instagram.
* To make an ever-lasting impression on the viewers.
* To target a specific location or people of a certain age, hobbies, and other interests.
* To help you increase your exposure and grow your sale.

Step1 Choose the type of coupon you want to create, i.e., a code or a task.

Step2 Next, open the Snapchat app on your device, and create or choose an image/video for your coupon. Make sure it's captivating and related to the theme.

### Idea 3\. Host A Contest Or Giveaway

You can also promote your business/brand on Snapchat by hosting a contest or giveaway. This can help you not only reach more people but also get them talking about your brand.

People love free products, so if you're giving away prizes, you can bet that they will be eager to follow you.

![content on snapchat](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/content-on-snapchat.jpg)

Such contests can also generate interest and excitement about your brand and can help your build relationships with your followers. By interacting with people and giving them a chance to win something, you're showing that you care about them.

## Part 4\. A Bonus Tip: Tracking and Analysing Snap Stats

Tracking and analyzing your snap stats can be difficult, but it's also important to do if you want to be successful on Snapchat. By understanding your snap stats, you can figure out what works and doesn't and adjust your Snapchat strategy accordingly.

So what stats should you be tracking on Snapchat? Here are a few of the most important ones:

* **Views:** This is a good metric to track if you want to see how many people are actually seeing your content. Keep an eye on your views over time to see if you're getting more or less engagement.
* **Screenshots:** Screenshots can be a good indicator of how viral your content is. If you're getting a lot of screenshots, it means people are sharing your content with others.
* **New Followers:** This will help you understand how effective your Snapchat marketing efforts are.
* **The Timing Of Your Snaps:** This will help you understand when your audience is most engaged and when they're most likely to see your snaps.
