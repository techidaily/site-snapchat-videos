 Least people had an idea that Snapchat offers a sleek video calling feature as well. So, we are bringing you the steps as how to video call someone using Snapchat without any trouble. Letâs see how you can enjoy communicating face to face from your respective placesâ

#### Step 1: Swipe right to start a video chat

 First of all, launch the latest version of Snapchat on your mobile and then swipe right on the camera to get the âFriendsâ list. You can also tap on the âFriendsâ tab found at the bottom left corner of the screen. Now, find the contact you want to make a Snapchat video call with, and tap or right swipe on it.

#### Step 2: Press video camera icon

 In this step, you will start calling your friend. For this, look for the video recorder icon on the next screen and tap on it to place the call. It should start ringing ASAP by sending them a chat request.

#### Step 3: Wait for answering

 Their phone will start ringing if they have enabled Snapchat notifications. Enabling notification will also let them know that youâre calling even if they are not using the app that time. Or else, they can only get the call, while using Snapchat.

 There are 3 options to respond to a call.

1. If they click on âWatchâ option, they can see you, but you arenât allowed for so.
2. If they tap âJoinâ option, it means both of you can see and talk to each other. In case they select âIgnoreâ option, you will get a busy message.
3. If you tap the green camera icon the video becomes one way, where only you can see them, but they wonât see you.

 Note: By swiping the screen down, you can minimize the Snapchat video call.
