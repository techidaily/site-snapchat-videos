In this post, I‚Äôm going to let you know how to add music to a Snapchat video without any hassle. Let‚Äôs get it started and level-up your Snapchat game!

Before we learn how to add music to your Snapchat video, let‚Äôs quickly get to know about the ‚ÄúSounds‚Äù feature of the app. If you have been using Instagram or TikTok, then you might be familiar with their music feature.

Similarly, in 2020, Snapchat has also included a Sound feature that lets us add music to our snaps (photos or videos).

While it doesn‚Äôt include all sorts of tracks, you can find most of the popular songs so that you can easily add music to a Snapchat video and make it interesting.

Once the other person would view your snap, they can hear the music playing in the background. If they want to listen to it or know more about the song, then they can just tap on its sticker on your snap.
