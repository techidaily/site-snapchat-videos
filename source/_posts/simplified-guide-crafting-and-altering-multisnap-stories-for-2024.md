## Part 2: How to Backup your Camera Roll to Snapchat without Creating Stories

In Snapchat, you can only save the camera roll videos having a maximum of 10-second length. It indicates that you cannot save the camera roll videos which exceed the 10-second limit.

The process to auto-save the stories to Memories is quite simple. For this, open the "Settings" of Snapchat and head to the "Memories" option. Under the heading called "Save Destination," tap on "Auto-Save My Story Snaps." Once done, enable the option "Auto-Save to Memories." Thus, your Snapchat stories will be automatically saved to your Memories.

## Wrap Up

Snapchat allows you to save the captured pictures and videos in their Memories. By doing so, you can save your device's storage space easily. Moreover, you can access the saved snaps in Memories by logging into your Snapchat from any device. That's why this article has offered a well-described guide on **how to back up the camera roll to Snapchat** in a simple way.
