### How To Edit Photos On Snapchat

Now that you've added your picture from the Camera roll, follow the steps below to edit it using the Snapchat image editing tools:

Step1 Click the **Edit** icon at the bottom-right of the selected picture. To add text, click the **T** icons, type whatever you want, select color by dragging the icon in the **color pane** and add the **text style.**

![snapchat editing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/snapchat-editing.jpg)

Step2 If you want to draw something on your picture, use the pencil icon. The draw function offers color panes, an emojis pen, and a color picker.

Step4 To set a time limit on your snap, click the **Clock** icon and set the limit. Finally, tap the **Done** icon to save a copy of the photo, or use the **Export** icon to share your picture on other social media platforms.

Step1 Tap the **paper** icon to the right side of your selected picture. This will take you to the Snapchat stickers library.

Step2 Since the stickers are placed in different categories, including recently used, popular, Bitmojis, etc., swipe right/left to get to the desired page.

Step1 Tap the **Paintbrush** icon from the Snapchat editing tools at the left of your picture.

Step2 Search for the theme using the **Search box** or scroll up and down to find the one you like.

Step3 Select the **theme** you want and tap on it to add to your photo. Keep in mind that Snapchat only adds themes to the original images, not from the **Camera Roll.**

### How To Attach A URL
