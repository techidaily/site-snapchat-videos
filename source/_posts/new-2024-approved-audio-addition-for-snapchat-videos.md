Before we learn how to add music to your Snapchat video, let‚Äôs quickly get to know about the ‚ÄúSounds‚Äù feature of the app. If you have been using Instagram or TikTok, then you might be familiar with their music feature.

Once the other person would view your snap, they can hear the music playing in the background. If they want to listen to it or know more about the song, then they can just tap on its sticker on your snap.
