## Efficient Techniques for Moving SnapShot to Photo Library

Snapchat is the most popular social media platform that is enjoyed by youngsters. The main reason lies in their unique filters that allow you to capture vibrant snaps. Moreover, the features of Snapchat, like emojis, drawings, and bitmojis, help you chat with your friends in an exciting manner. Hence, it's an excellent app for taking interesting and vibrant snaps flawlessly.

If you are a regular user of Snapchat and want to learn **how to save snaps to the camera roll**, this article will help you. By applying the suggested methods, you can save your snaps to the smartphone.

## Part 1: Save Snaps to Camera Roll or Gallery Instead of Memories

If you want to share your snaps on other social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook, you should save your snaps on your phone's gallery. The saved snaps in your phone's gallery can be located and shared on other platforms without hassle. Read the following instructions on **how to save snaps to the camera roll** or gallery quickly:

Step1 Navigate to your Snapchat and tap on your Bitmoji icon displayed in the top left corner. Afterward, select the "Settings" icon displayed at the top right corner.

![choose settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/save-snaps-to-camera-roll-1.jpg)

Step2 On the Settings menu, head to the My Account section and tap "Memories." In this new menu, tap on the "Save Button," where you can choose to save your snaps on either Camera Roll and Memories or Only Camera Roll. Tap on your preferred choice to export your snaps to your phone's gallery.

Step1 Open your Snapchat and tap on the "Snaps" icon given below. This will open all the captured snaps on your phone.

## Part 3: Save Multiple Snaps to Camera Roll at Once

Many people like to capture pictures of a particular event on their Snapchat. However, if your taken snaps are not saved in the camera roll, you may have difficulty sharing the images with others on other social media apps. You can save time by saving multiple snaps to the camera roll all at once. Through the following steps, you can learn **how to save snaps to the camera roll** all at once:

Step1 Open your Snapchat and swipe up from the bottom using your finger. This will open all the captured snaps on your screen.

## Part 4: How To Change Where Photos Are Saved in Snapchat

Some people like to save the phone's storage by saving the snaps to memories. If you prefer saving the snaps in memories instead of the camera roll, you can save the phone's storage space. Conversely, some people like to export their snaps to the camera roll if multiple people use their Snapchat.

For privacy matters, people like to save the snaps to the camera roll only. If you want to change the location where the photos are saved, you can check the below instructions:

Step1 Head to your Snapchat and tap on the Profile icon displayed in the top left corner. From there, select the "Settings" icon to proceed.
