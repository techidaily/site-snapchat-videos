If you’re a Snapchat user, you will have spotted the [emojis](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that appear in your friends list next to the names of your friends. These **Snapchat emojis** don’t simply remain the same forever, but instead change over the course of time, and the changes themselves are based on the way that you interact with your friend. Only you are able to see the emojis. The Snapchat emojis themselves include stars, hearts, faces and more.

* [**Part2: How to change the streak emojis on Snapchat**](#part2)
* [**Part3: How to get a Bitmoji on Snapchat**](#part3)
* [**Part4: Why to use Snapchat emojis**](#part4)

## Part 1: What do exactly the Snapchat emojis mean?

In this section, we will tell you all about the different emojis on Snapchat. If you’ve been wondering what the Snap emoji meanings actually are, read on. A Gold Star next to someone’s name means they have replaced your snaps during the past 24 hours. A Yellow Star means you are #1 best friends with one another. You will send your largest amount of snaps to them and vice versa.

A Red Heart snap emoji is used to say that you have been #1 Bfs for a fortnight without interruption, whilst a Pink Heart Snapchat best friend emoji tells that that this has been the case for two months. If you see a baby emoji, this means you have only recently become friends with the person.

![snapchat emojis](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snapchat-emojis.JPG)

Have you seen a Face with Sunglasses? This means the person is B.Fs with one of your best friends and you send plenty of snaps to someone that they send many snaps to. A Grimacing Face tells you that your #1 is also their #1 friend and that the person you send the most snaps to is the same person they send the vast majority of their snaps to.

The Smirking Face shows that you are one of their B.Fs without this being reciprocated. In other words, they send you many snaps but you don’t return the favor. A Smiling Face means that you are good friends with someone but they aren’t quite your #1 B.F.

## Part 2: How to change the streak emojis on Snapchat

If you’re not happy with the emojis that you are seeing or you feel that they are not accurate for the person in question, don’t worry – these can easily be changed. You can switch the emojis by taking the following steps.

* Open Snapchat and swipe down
* Tap Settings
* Tap Manage Preferences
* Tap Friend Emojis
* Tap the icon that you want to change
* Tap the emoji that you wish to use

## Part 3: How to get a Bitmoji on Snapchat

Snapchat purchased Bitmoji creator Bitstrips in 2016 in an attempt to capitalise on the popularity of emojis. It is now possible to link your Bitmoji account to your Snapchat one, and it only takes a few moments to connect the two. By doing so, you can enjoy greater customisation options and enhance the experience of using Snapchat.

Take these steps if you wish to get a personal Bitmoji on Snapchat.

#### 1\. Open your Snapchat settings

Swipe down on your home screen, tapping the gear icon located in the top right-hand corner of your screen.

You can find this in the ‘My Account’ section. Those that have already registered with Bitmoji will be able to link their account in the next step, but if you haven’t, you will need to set up a new Bitmoji account.

![bitmoji](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/bitmoji-setting.JPG)

#### 2\. Agree and connect

You will now be able to link your Bitmoji account up to your Snapchat account. This means you can easily share your very own Bitmoji character with your followers on Snapchat and make the experience of using the service even more fun and personal to you.

## Part 4: Why to use Snapchat emojis

There are many great reasons for using Snapchat. The platform first appeared way back in September and has attracted millions upon millions of users since then. Snapchat may be strongly associated with teenagers, but it is used by adults of all ages. When you use Snapchat, the content you share is more direct and personal and is only seen by the people you want to see it, for ten seconds only. Snapchat is great for privacy, and if anyone attempts to take a screenshot of your content you will be notified.

Another reason so many people use Snapchat is that there are no complex settings to leave you confused. It also simplifies the video calling process and makes it much less complicated than other video communication platforms. Snapchat has also become a major marketing tool for businesses around the world, allowing them to connect with and promote their services to a wider range of tech-loving users.

# Top 20 Snapchat Filters & Lenses to Make Your Snaps Special

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg)

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Technology, certainly, has come a long way. In this era of digitalization, one can easily interact with friends on social media. With the emergence of social media, it has now become convenient to maintain social connections and support networks that otherwise wouldn’t have been possible. Social networking platforms have made staying connected with friends, family, and other acquaintances easier than ever.

Snapchat is one such platform that has gained immense popularity over recent years. A multimedia messaging app, it allows you to share pictures and videos with your friends and dear ones. The app lets you take snaps and apply filters and lenses to best express yourself. You can use the **best Snapchat filters** and lenses to add personality and whimsy to snaps.

Whether you want to have some fun with your friends or want to impress someone, Snapchat has amazing effects for every occasion. Indeed, Instagram’s story highlights have become one of the biggest social media platforms. However, by the end of June 2021, Snapchat claimed to have increased its global daily active users to 293 million.

Snapchat’s lenses and filters have become so famous that Instagram has mimicked the feature. But, there’s a reason why snaps are regularly circulating outside Snapchat - the fantastic creative effects give it a leg up over Instagram. Snapchat’s extensive collection of funny lenses, cool filters, and stunning beauty filters makes it way better than Instagram’s.

Wondering how to find good face modifiers from a sea of clones out there? Relax! Our team at Wondershare has done the hard work and made a list of the best filters and lenses on Snapchat. But, first, let’s have a detailed insight into the best Snapchat filters and lenses.

* [Part 1: What Are the Differences Between Snapchat Filters and Lenses?](#part1)
* [Part 2: 20 Best Filters & Lenses On Snapchat to Use in 2021](#part2)
* [Part 3: FAQs About Snapchat Filters & Lenses](#part3)

## Part 1: What Are the Differences Between Snapchat Filters and Lenses?

Snapchat filters are static overlays and sit on the top of your photo or video. In contrast, Snapchat lenses are dynamic, augmented reality animations that alter your voice along with your appearance as you move on the screen. Unlike filters that are added after taking a photo, lenses are displayed while you’re taking the photo.

The best filters on Snapchat let you change a snap’s tint or change the direction or speed in which your video is played back. On the other hand, Snapchat lenses work by utilizing facial recognition software to track your features and apply an animation that follows your facial movements. While lenses can change the sound of your voice and the appearance of your face, filters can only add color tones, messages, customized images, and icons to your snaps.

The photo and video sharing app allow you to make your own filters and lenses. Creating a filter on Snapchat isn’t free as you will have to pay a certain amount based on the filter’s square foot. However, when it comes to making your own Snapchat lens, you won’t have to pay any fees as the entire process is free.

## Part 2: 20 Best Filters & Lenses On Snapchat to Use in 2021

## Part 1: What Are the Differences Between Snapchat Filters and Lenses?

Snapchat filters are static overlays and sit on the top of your photo or video. In contrast, Snapchat lenses are dynamic, augmented reality animations that alter your voice along with your appearance as you move on the screen. Unlike filters that are added after taking a photo, lenses are displayed while you’re taking the photo.

The best filters on Snapchat let you change a snap’s tint or change the direction or speed in which your video is played back. On the other hand, Snapchat lenses work by utilizing facial recognition software to track your features and apply an animation that follows your facial movements. While lenses can change the sound of your voice and the appearance of your face, filters can only add color tones, messages, customized images, and icons to your snaps.

The photo and video sharing app allow you to make your own filters and lenses. Creating a filter on Snapchat isn’t free as you will have to pay a certain amount based on the filter’s square foot.

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Technology, certainly, has come a long way. In this era of digitalization, one can easily interact with friends on social media. With the emergence of social media, it has now become convenient to maintain social connections and support networks that otherwise wouldn’t have been possible. Social networking platforms have made staying connected with friends, family, and other acquaintances easier than ever.

Snapchat is one such platform that has gained immense popularity over recent years. A multimedia messaging app, it allows you to share pictures and videos with your friends and dear ones. The app lets you take snaps and apply filters and lenses to best express yourself. You can use the **best Snapchat filters** and lenses to add personality and whimsy to snaps.

Whether you want to have some fun with your friends or want to impress someone, Snapchat has amazing effects for every occasion. Indeed, Instagram’s story highlights have become one of the biggest social media platforms. However, by the end of June 2021, Snapchat claimed to have increased its global daily active users to 293 million.

Snapchat’s lenses and filters have become so famous that Instagram has mimicked the feature. But, there’s a reason why snaps are regularly circulating outside Snapchat - the fantastic creative effects give it a leg up over Instagram. Snapchat’s extensive collection of funny lenses, cool filters, and stunning beauty filters makes it way better than Instagram’s.

Wondering how to find good face modifiers from a sea of clones out there? Relax! Our team at Wondershare has done the hard work and made a list of the best filters and lenses on Snapchat. But, first, let’s have a detailed insight into the best Snapchat filters and lenses.

* [Part 2: 20 Best Filters & Lenses On Snapchat to Use in 2021](#part2)
* [Part 3: FAQs About Snapchat Filters & Lenses](#part3)

## Part 1: What Are the Differences Between Snapchat Filters and Lenses?

Snapchat filters are static overlays and sit on the top of your photo or video. In contrast, Snapchat lenses are dynamic, augmented reality animations that alter your voice along with your appearance as you move on the screen. Unlike filters that are added after taking a photo, lenses are displayed while you’re taking the photo.

The best filters on Snapchat let you change a snap’s tint or change the direction or speed in which your video is played back. On the other hand, Snapchat lenses work by utilizing facial recognition software to track your features and apply an animation that follows your facial movements. While lenses can change the sound of your voice and the appearance of your face, filters can only add color tones, messages, customized images, and icons to your snaps.

The photo and video sharing app allow you to make your own filters and lenses. Creating a filter on Snapchat isn’t free as you will have to pay a certain amount based on the filter’s square foot. However, when it comes to making your own Snapchat lens, you won’t have to pay any fees as the entire process is free.
