The platform is incredibly engaging with the great potential, and providing opportunies for both individual and business.

However, how to make your Snaps stand out and make sure your Snaps and Snapchat videos are seen by as many audiences as possible and are interesting enough to hold their attention?

In this article, we're going to give you some **ideas to post on Snapchat**. From generating inspiring ideas to using Snapchat for better marketing, we aim to provide you with guidance on the whole walkthrough of shining on Snapchat.

## Part 1\. Choosing Creative Topics for Snapchat Video

On the top of that, we will start with coming up with creative ideas for your Snapchat videos. If you're struggling to develop **ideas to post on Snapchat**, don't worry - we've got you covered.

Below we've provided some tips for your Snapchat videos:

### Idea 1\. Conduct Interviews Via Snaps

If you are running your Snapchat like a YouTube channel, conducting interviews on Snapchat is a perfect way to get quick, candid responses from your interviewees. To make it more fun, captivating, and engaging, you can also use captivating Snaps to add a personal touch.

All you need is: set lighting and sound, a 10-second snap with a question on it, and the interviewee. Start by introducing the person in the frame, put the snap on the screen, and let the interviewee answer your question.

To make things interesting, add [filters](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), stickers, or [lenses](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to reflect the scenarios or your personality. In the outro, provide a snap to thank the interviewee and share their Snapcode to let people follow them, a call to action, a positive phrase like thanks for watching, or your other social media handles.

### Idea 2\. Host A YouTube And Snapchat Q&A

Another great idea is to host a YouTube and Snapchat Q&A. You can film with a famous snap chatter or YouTuber and ask them a few questions. You can also ask your followers/audience to send their questions via text message or response to your stories. This will help you get your viewers involved with your content and increase engagement.

To make sure your snap Q&A goes off without a hitch, be sure to:

* Set up your Snapchat settings of **"Who Can Contact Me"** to **"Everyone"** for a while to allow for questions.
* During the session, try to acknowledge who asked the question.
* After the session, change the "**Who Can Contact Me"** setting back to **only friends** to avoid spam overload.

### Idea 3\. Fun Tidbits

Snapchat is an excellent platform to get your audience engaged with your brand by creating fun tidbits to get more traffic.

You can create short videos or images designed to be entertaining and informative. For example, Amazon's Snapchat posts stories of their employees carving pumpkins and posting them to their followers. This is a creative and fun solution to reach new customers and create a brand personality.

![amazon tidbit on snapchat](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/amazon-tidbit-on-snapchat.jpg)

### Idea 4\. Behind-The-Scenes Footage

Sharing BTS footage of you and your team hard at work can be interesting and informative for your followers. This will give them a look at the inner workings of your company and how you create your products or services. This type of content can also be used to show off your team's personality and culture.

We have listed why Behind-the-scenes footages are useful for your reference:

* Helps build trust with your audience.
* Allows you to humanize your brand or business and make it more relatable.
* Enables you to connect with your audience on a deeper level.

There are numerous ways to use BTS footage to boost your business. For example, you can use it to create a more personal connection with your customers, increase transparency and build trust.

## Part 2\. Snapchat Post Ideas for Content Creation

Above is about some creative ideas for picking topics for your Snapchat videos. Apart from that, the video's content is also important to hold the audience's attention. Whether you're a blogger, a small business owner, or just someone who likes to create content, unique presenting ways can help you stand out on Snapchat.

If you're not sure where to start, here are some ideas for Snapchat content that you can create:

### Idea 1\. Create Title Cards For Longer Snapchat Stories

If you're creating a Snapchat story that is longer than the standard 10 seconds, you can use title cards to help keep your viewers engaged.

Title cards are simply images with the text you can insert into your story to help identify what's coming next. For example, if you're sharing a story about your company's history, you could use a title card at the beginning of each section to identify the different parts of the story.

For this, you can take a snap of a wall or perhaps block your camera to get a black screen and then paste your text on the picture. You can also play with the font size, style, or color to create engaging title cards.

![title cards for snapchat stories](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/title-cards-for-snapchat-stories.jpg)

### Idea 2\. Adding Music To Your Video

Adding music to your video on Snapchat is important because this can help set the mood and tone of your video, express yourself or your personality, and make the content more fun and interesting to watch.

You can [add music from the Snapchat build-in library](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) or find resources from third-party websites, such as:

* [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/music/)
* [Bensound](https://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music/2)
* [Mixkit](https://mixkit.co/free-stock-music/)
* [Tunetank](https://tunetank.com/)
* [Motionarray](https://motionarray.com/browse/royalty-free-music/)

### Idea 3\. Make Full Use of Snapchat's Filters

One way to create shareable and fun content is by making full use of Snapchat's filters. For this, the app offers a ton of different filters to choose from, so you can really get creative while using them

##### 1\. Utilizing Geofilters

These are location-based filters that you can use if you are planning an event or promoting your product. Creating your own on-demand geofilters are super affordable and are priced according to location, time frame, and square footage you want, starting from $5.

However, you can only target an area between 20,000 and 5 million square feet. Moreover, they can only stay active for up to 30 days.

![snapchat on demand geo filters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/snapchat-on-demand-geo-filters.jpg)

##### 2\. With AR/VR filters

We all love filters, don't we? Whether it's a dog filter or a flower crown, filters add a touch of fun and personality to our photos and videos. With the advent of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technology, filters are getting even more creative and immersive.

Snapchat's AR/VR filters are some of the most fun and innovative on the market, and they're constantly adding new ones to keep users engaged. You can also use these filters to create interactive content for your business.

For example, Dior created a Men Saddle Belt filter to promote its product and in turn, gained more sales, brand recognition as well as engagement.

![dior filter on snapchat](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/dior-filter-on-snapchat.jpg)

##### 3\. Using Filters In Your Snaps Or Stories

When you are taking a Snap or creating a story, you can add filters to your photos or videos to add some visual interest and variation. These filters can change the color of your picture, add text or graphics, or even give them a fun effect.

Applying filters to your snaps is easy - just swipe through the options to find the perfect look. You can even use two or more filters at once by holding down on your screen to keep your current one set while you swipe to add more.

To find more fun and interesting hidden filters, read our article: [How to find Snapchat hidden filters naturally](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

### Idea 4\. Adopting Lenses

When it comes to Snapchat, there are two things that users love: filters and lenses!

While filters enhance your photos, lenses take Snapchat to a whole new level by adding animations and effects to your photos and videos. And the best part is, there are lenses for just about everything!

So, how can you use lenses to create engaging Snapchat content? Here are a few ideas:

* Add fun animations and effects to your photos and videos.
* Create custom snaps that show off your brand personality.
* Make your content unique and engaging to stand out from the rest.

There are endless possibilities when creating marketing and promotional content for Snapchat. So whether you're looking to boost brand awareness, generate leads, or drive sales, there's a Snapchat post idea for you.

Not sure where to start? Below, we'll share some of our favorite marketing and promotional content **ideas to post on Snapchat:**

A Quick Guide:

1. [1\. Techniques for Better Marketing On Snapchat](#part3-1)
2. [2\. Ideas for Better Promotion on Snapchat](#part3-2)

### 1\. Techniques for Better Marketing On Snapchat

Here are some techniques to create an engaging marketing campaign on Snapchat:

### Idea 1\. Newsletter Sign-up CTAs

Adding a newsletter sign-up [CTA](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/call-action-cta.asp) to your Snapchat marketing campaign can help you grow your email list and keep your audience engaged. Here's how to do it:

* Create a beautiful and compelling newsletter sign-up CTA.
* Add the CTA to your Snapchat story.
* Encourage your audience to sign up for your newsletter.
* Follow up with your new subscribers and welcome them to your community.

### Idea 2\. Use Short Links

Since you cannot add clickable links to your snaps, using a shortened URL is an excellent approach to help people follow up on your links.

To get started, you need to find a URL shortener service such as [bitly.com](https://bitly.com/) and then begin sharing your shortened URLs with your Snapchat followers. You can add them to your snaps or post them in your story.

### Idea 3\. Sneak Peeks Of New Products

Giving your followers/customers a sneak peek of new products before they hit the shelves can excite them about your brand. This not only builds anticipation and excitement but also gives your fans a chance to be the first to know how and when to get their hands on your new products.

You can provide sneak peeks of new products on Snapchat in a number of ways. For instance, you can give short previews or teasers of products in your upcoming collection or first look at new products. You can even use Snapchat to give your fans a behind-the-scenes look at how your products are made.

Whatever approach you take, ensure that you're providing value to your audience. They should feel like they're getting something special by having a sneak peek of your new products.

### Idea 4\. Attach Your Username, Username URL, Or Snapchat Code

To get more audiences and followers on Snapchat, you can also try attaching your username, username URL, or Snapcode to your stories. These three approaches can help your customers find your account or add you as a friend on Snapchat.

To share your Snapchat username URL, open **Snapchat** and click your **Profile** icon. Tap on your **yellow Snapcode** to access more options. Tap **"Share My Profile Link"** and select the platform you want to share it with.

To share your Snapcode, simply let others scan the code via their phone's camera or tap **"Profile > Snapcode icon > Share Snapcode."**

![share snapcode or profile url](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/share-snapcode-or-profile-url.jpg)

### Idea 5\. Publish Your Snaps To Other Platforms

So what stats should you be tracking on Snapchat? Here are a few of the most important ones:
