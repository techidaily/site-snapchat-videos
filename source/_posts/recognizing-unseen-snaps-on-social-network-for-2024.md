## Introduction of how to know if someone blocked you on Snapchat?

It's a real shame when your social media accounts are permanently disabled. Everyone in the modern world depends on social media to remain in touch. As a result, being blocked may be a devastating experience for a person's mental health. In this guide, we are going to discuss how to know if someone blocked you on Snapchat?

Snapchat and other similar applications fail to inform you if your account has been blocked. I will let you know how to know if someone blocked you on Snapchat. So, you can keep your attention on the good things in life instead of the bad.

However, if you discover that how to know if someone blocked you on Snapchat, consider why this would be the case. If you're having trouble messaging someone, don't attempt to use several accounts. If you approach the situation calmly, you may learn why you were banned on Snapchat. Alternatively, the individual may have canceled your account or removed you from their list of Friends or Contacts.

A deleted account differs from a banned account in that it is no longer accessible.

## Blocked vs. removed: What's the difference?

Snapchat's blocking system differs from those other social media sites. The individual who is blocked won't know if they've been blocked since they won't know how to find out. Even if they are no longer friends, the guy who blocked them will seem to be. They'll remain in your chat list and in your friend's list, but they won't be able to see any messages you send. You won't even be able to access their blogs or other online information.

Being blocked on Snapchat, on the other hand, is a very other matter. This indicates that another person has unfriended you. Your most recent conversations with this individual may be hidden from view. You won't see them on your buddy list, but you may search for them if you know the username.

## How can you know if someone on Snapchat has banned you?

### 1.Check your recent chats with them

![way1-check-your-recent-chats-with-them](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/way1-check-your-recent-chats-with-them.png)

It's possible that the other user deleted their account or was barred if your recent conversations don't appear despite being preserved.

### 2.Send them a message if you can

You can snap someone you've spoken to in the past if you've previously interacted with them. If you notice a pending or grey indicator after sending it, they may have removed you from the contact list. 'Failed to send a message - Tap to try again' may indicate that you have been blocked. Snapchat, on the other hand, will display all of your messages as 'delivered,' even if you have been banned.

### 3.Check your list of Friends to see whether they're there

To see this list, just go to your profile & click on My Friends. If they don't show up, they may have blocked you. They might have canceled their account or disabled you from their Friends list.

### 4.Verify whether or not you can view their tales on the internet

Searching for someone active on Instagram may need you to read their recent stories first. If you're unable to, you've probably been blocked.

### 5. Verify whether you can see their Snapchat rating

![way5-verify-whether-you-can-see-their-snapchat-rating](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/way5-verify-whether-you-can-see-their-snapchat-rating.png)

Snapchat scores are only visible to friends. Otherwise, your Snapchat account has been suspended or terminated.

### 6. Use a separate account to do a name search

It's possible they deactivated their account to ensure you can use a different account to search for their username if you don't find them there. If they do appear, you may be sure they blocked you after removing you.

Snapchat hides the fact that someone has banned you from view. I really hope this information was useful to you in some manner. Approaching the individual who has obstructed you should be done with caution. Keep in mind why you were first barred, and attempt to avoid making the same error repeatedly.

### 7. Look for the person's username and full name

![way7-look-for-persons-username-full-name](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/way7-look-for-persons-username-full-name.png)

When you search for someone on Snapchat and they've banned you, you won't be able to find them. Searching for them should bring them up even if they've unfriended you on Facebook.

It's critical to know the difference between Snapchat's blocking and deleting features. If someone has banned your account, you won't be able to locate it anywhere and you won't be able to communicate with it from the blocked account either.

Even if someone removes you from the Friends list, you'll still be able to send them snaps since they'll appear on your Friends list. It's possible, though, that they won't get them if they only let their friends contact them because of their privacy settings.

Use the magnifying glass icon just at top of the screen just on the chats or snaps tab to look for the individual who you believe blocked you. If you wish to find a certain person, start by inputting their username or last name.

**Tip!**

If you are wondering how to know if someone blocked you on Snapchat, using their username is your best bet. This is due to the fact that user names are distinct from complete names.

• Efficient workflow and easy-to-understand videos.

• Even beginners can benefit from these tutorials.

## Cutting-Edge Methods: Backing Up iPhone Photos to Snapchat

Many people haven't backed up their camera roll to Snapchat due to the default settings. If you want to save each photo or video from your device on the Snapchat cloud, backing up the camera to the Memories is necessary. By doing so, you cannot lose important photos or videos from your phone.

If you change the default settings of the Memories created from the camera roll, Snapchat will automatically create a backup of your Memories. In this regard, this article will guide you on **how to back up the camera roll to Snapchat** in the easiest way.

## Part 1: Backing up automatically - Creating Snapchat Stories from your Camera Roll

If you don't want to alter the settings of your camera roll, this part will offer you an easy method. Through this method, you can create Snapchat stories from the camera roll directly. By doing so, you can instantly save the camera roll photos to your Snapchat without backing up. To make a Snapchat story from your camera roll, read the following instructions:

Step1 Open your Snapchat and swipe up from the bottom. Head to the Camera Roll section and select any photo.

![access camera roll](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/back-up-camera-roll-to-snapchat-1.jpg)

Step2 After selecting a particular photo or video, hit the "Arrow" icon. Afterward, tap on the "My Story" option to create a story. For confirmation, press the "Arrow" icon again. This will create a Snapchat story instantly from your Camera Roll.

## Part 2: How to Backup your Camera Roll to Snapchat without Creating Stories

In Snapchat, you can only save the camera roll videos having a maximum of 10-second length. It indicates that you cannot save the camera roll videos which exceed the 10-second limit. Furthermore, there are various ways that enable you to make a Camera Roll backup on Snapchat. In this part, we will guide you on how to save a Camera roll photo or video on Snapchat without creating a story. Also, these steps are applicable on both Android and iOS devices:

Step1 After opening your Snapchat app, open your Memories by swiping up. Proceed to your "Camera Roll" section and long-press on any picture. This will let you select any photo or video on your Camera Roll.

## Part 3: How to Check Your Backup Progress

To ensure a complete backup of your Memories on Snapchat, a stable Wi-Fi connection is mandatory. That's why make sure to connect your phone with a stable and strong internet connection. Moreover, if you have chosen multiple photos or videos from the Camera Roll, you can save them as a story on Snapchat.

Step1 Once you have opened your Snapchat, tap on your Bitmoji icon. From there, proceed to the "Settings" by tapping on the gear icon.

![open snapchat settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/back-up-camera-roll-to-snapchat-5.jpg)

If you enable this feature, Snapchat will automatically create a backup through a stable internet connection.
