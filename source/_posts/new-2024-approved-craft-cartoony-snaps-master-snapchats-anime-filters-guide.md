The best part about anime filter is that it has the ability to transform your videos and images into anime instantly. This filter has already gone viral on other social media platforms, such as TikTok, Instagram, and Twitter.

Filters and effects are not new when it comes to social media services, and almost all of them have their own versions, which you can use. Snapchat is here with a new lens, which is becoming immensely popular. If you have been trying to use the **Snapchat anime** filter and don't know how to go about it, you have come to the right place because this article will talk about how to get this filter and how to use it. Keep reading!

## Part 1: What is Anime Filter on Snapchat?

Out of the many AR lenses from Snapchat, the latest one is the anime lens. It's a filter that will morph a person's photo or video into an anime character and will customize the anime face based on the person's facial features. So, rather than simply applying a generic image on top of your face, Snapchat makes sure that the anime image looks similar to your actual image. And as a result, each person's anime face turns out to be different.

Since the hashtag #animefilter is trending, you can also apply the anime filter on your face and be a part of the trend. The reaction to this filter is lowkey amazing because the filter not only changes your face and makes it look like a part of a hit anime cartoon series or movie, but it sometimes also changes your hair color making you look like the King of the Pirates or Rapunzel. What this lens will do and how your image will turn out to be is highly fascinating.

What stands out is that after the **anime** **filter** **of** **Snapchat** was released, it has been used over 3 billion times. Snapchat has confirmed this statistic in its Third Quarter 2020 Financial report, and they even said that they already knew it would be a massive hit.

## Part 2: How to Get the Anime Filter on Snapchat?

Now that you know how popular the **Snapchat anime filter** is. It's worth knowing how to get it. Although this filter is available on Snapchat, many users are facing issues finding it. This section will show you two easy ways to get this filter. You can use one or both methods and start using the filter to show the world how you will look like an anime character. Here are the two ways:

### Method 1: Get the Anime Face Filter on Snapchat via Link

**Step 1:**  First, click on the link [here](https://www.snapchat.com/unlock/?type=SNAPCODE&uuid=ff9460034fee44a08e9a4282560cce36&metadata=01). You will need this link to get the anime face filter.

**Step 2:**  Once you click on the click, a pop-up window will open. If you haven't downloaded the anime filter yet, then Snapchat will say, "New lens found." Right below it, you will see the message "unlock for 48 hours." Go ahead and click on that.

![Unlock the snapchat anime filter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/unlock-anime-filter-for-48-hours.jpg)

**Step 3:**  By clicking on the purple button, your **Snapchat anime** filter will be available for use for 48 hours.

Here's a pro tip, if you want to continue using this filter, once the 48 hours are over, simply repeat the steps, and you can use it for additional 48 hours. Simple!

If the pop-up says, “nothing to see here”, which means you have the filter already. In this case, you can go to Snapchat and click the filter accordingly.

### Method 2: Get the Anime Style Filter via Explore on Snapchat

If you don’t want to click any unknown links, you can explore the anime filter by searching on Snapchat.

**Step 1:**  Make sure your Snapchat is up-to-date. If not, update it to the latest version.

**Step 2:**  Open Snapchat on your mobile or tablet, whichever you are using. Now, turn the lens towards you or someone else as if you are clicking a picture.

**Step 3:**  Now, click on the smiley face filter button, and tap on the Explore button to continue.

![Explore the snapchat anime filter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/explore-anime-style-filter-snapchat.jpg)

**Step 4:**  You can now search for Anime Styles. There are several anime filters available, just make sure that the creator of the filter is Snapchat.

**Step 5:**  Once you have the anime filter, you can record a video of yourself, or take photos. You may also use both back and front cameras to turn anyone into an anime character.

**Pro tip:**  This filter works on already saved photos and videos as well. Try them on too. This filter will work only on your face, though. So, it won't turn your entire body into an anime character.

## Part 3: How Do I Get More Filters on Snapchat?

Since Snapchat keeps coming up with attractive filters, you may wonder how you can get more filters to keep using them. Well, there are a few tricks that you can try. We will explain these tricks in detail, so make sure to follow them correctly.

### Trick 1: Turn on Snapchat Geofilters

Before you try using Snapchat geofilters, you will first have to permit Snapchat to access your location. Whether you are using iOS or Android, enable location, and you will start seeing geofilters and all the other filters that you have saved.

Don't expect a plethora of filters to suddenly turn up. For example, when you apply a geofilter, you will see that it adds an illustration and the place name to your Snap. So, the more you explore and go out, the more filters you will start seeing.

### Trick 2: Check Online Resources on Lens Studio and Lenslist

You can also explore two filter libraries, which are Lens Studio and Lenslist. These are repositories of AR content. These two libraries have many attractive filters. All you need to do is scan the Snapcode available in the filters and unlock them. Both of them will have duplicate filters as well, though. But dig a bit deeper, and you will have enough codes of filters to keep using them every day. You will find these codes in your profile once you add them.

### Trick 3: Share Snapcodes for Snapchat

The last way to add Snapcode of filters is by scanning other people's codes. Once you go to your profile, you will see your Snapcodes, which other people can scan. Just like that, you can scan other people's code as well. Some codes will be available for 24 hours, while others for 48 hours. After that, you can scan the code again when you want to reuse them. To scan a code, just hold your camera over the code and allow the screen to register it.

## Bonus: How to Add Anime Effect to Video with Filmora

As we shared, Snapchat will only morph your face into an anime character. But if you are not satisfied with that and want to turn a whole video into anime or cartoon, then one of the best ways to go about it is by getting Wondershare Filmora. Filmora is an easy-to-use yet powerful enough video editing tool loaded with stunning effects, such as cartoons, sketches, color sketches, and more. The process is very easy to follow, and to use Filmora, you don't need to be a pro. Here are the steps that you can follow:

**Step 1:** Launch Wondershare Filmora to your Mac or Windows computer. If you haven’t downloaded it yet, click the Try It Free button below to start.

[![Download Filmora  Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora   Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

**Step 2:**  Now, import media files and load the video that you want to convert into a cartoon or anime to the media library, and then add that video to the timeline.

Note: If you want to add the sketch effect to the person only, you can use the Human Segmentation in AI Portrait. In this way, you can also try the Cartoon effect to see the result.

So, rather than simply applying a generic image on top of your face, Snapchat makes sure that the anime image looks similar to your actual image. And as a result, each person's anime face turns out to be different.

Since the hashtag #animefilter is trending, you can also apply the anime filter on your face and be a part of the trend. The reaction to this filter is lowkey amazing because the filter not only changes your face and makes it look like a part of a hit anime cartoon series or movie, but it sometimes also changes your hair color making you look like the King of the Pirates or Rapunzel. What this lens will do and how your image will turn out to be is highly fascinating.

What stands out is that after the **anime** **filter** **of** **Snapchat** was released, it has been used over 3 billion times. Snapchat has confirmed this statistic in its Third Quarter 2020 Financial report, and they even said that they already knew it would be a massive hit.

## Part 2: How to Get the Anime Filter on Snapchat?

Now that you know how popular the **Snapchat anime filter** is. It's worth knowing how to get it. Although this filter is available on Snapchat, many users are facing issues finding it. This section will show you two easy ways to get this filter. You can use one or both methods and start using the filter to show the world how you will look like an anime character. Here are the two ways:

### Method 1: Get the Anime Face Filter on Snapchat via Link

**Step 1:**  First, click on the link [here](https://www.snapchat.com/unlock/?type=SNAPCODE&uuid=ff9460034fee44a08e9a4282560cce36&metadata=01). You will need this link to get the anime face filter.

**Step 2:**  Once you click on the click, a pop-up window will open. If you haven't downloaded the anime filter yet, then Snapchat will say, "New lens found." Right below it, you will see the message "unlock for 48 hours." Go ahead and click on that.

![Unlock the snapchat anime filter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/unlock-anime-filter-for-48-hours.jpg)

**Step 3:**  By clicking on the purple button, your **Snapchat anime** filter will be available for use for 48 hours.

Here's a pro tip, if you want to continue using this filter, once the 48 hours are over, simply repeat the steps, and you can use it for additional 48 hours. Simple!

If the pop-up says, “nothing to see here”, which means you have the filter already. In this case, you can go to Snapchat and click the filter accordingly.

### Method 2: Get the Anime Style Filter via Explore on Snapchat

If you don’t want to click any unknown links, you can explore the anime filter by searching on Snapchat.

**Step 1:**  Make sure your Snapchat is up-to-date. If not, update it to the latest version.

**Step 2:**  Open Snapchat on your mobile or tablet, whichever you are using. Now, turn the lens towards you or someone else as if you are clicking a picture.

**Step 3:**  Now, click on the smiley face filter button, and tap on the Explore button to continue.

![Explore the snapchat anime filter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/explore-anime-style-filter-snapchat.jpg)

**Step 4:**  You can now search for Anime Styles. There are several anime filters available, just make sure that the creator of the filter is Snapchat.

**Step 5:**  Once you have the anime filter, you can record a video of yourself, or take photos. You may also use both back and front cameras to turn anyone into an anime character.

**Pro tip:**  This filter works on already saved photos and videos as well. Try them on too. This filter will work only on your face, though. So, it won't turn your entire body into an anime character.

## Part 3: How Do I Get More Filters on Snapchat?

Since Snapchat keeps coming up with attractive filters, you may wonder how you can get more filters to keep using them. Well, there are a few tricks that you can try. We will explain these tricks in detail, so make sure to follow them correctly.

### Trick 1: Turn on Snapchat Geofilters

Before you try using Snapchat geofilters, you will first have to permit Snapchat to access your location. Whether you are using iOS or Android, enable location, and you will start seeing geofilters and all the other filters that you have saved.

Don't expect a plethora of filters to suddenly turn up. For example, when you apply a geofilter, you will see that it adds an illustration and the place name to your Snap. So, the more you explore and go out, the more filters you will start seeing.

### Trick 2: Check Online Resources on Lens Studio and Lenslist

You can also explore two filter libraries, which are Lens Studio and Lenslist. These are repositories of AR content. These two libraries have many attractive filters. All you need to do is scan the Snapcode available in the filters and unlock them. Both of them will have duplicate filters as well, though. But dig a bit deeper, and you will have enough codes of filters to keep using them every day. You will find these codes in your profile once you add them.

### Trick 3: Share Snapcodes for Snapchat

The last way to add Snapcode of filters is by scanning other people's codes. Once you go to your profile, you will see your Snapcodes, which other people can scan. Just like that, you can scan other people's code as well. Some codes will be available for 24 hours, while others for 48 hours. After that, you can scan the code again when you want to reuse them. To scan a code, just hold your camera over the code and allow the screen to register it.

## Bonus: How to Add Anime Effect to Video with Filmora

As we shared, Snapchat will only morph your face into an anime character. But if you are not satisfied with that and want to turn a whole video into anime or cartoon, then one of the best ways to go about it is by getting Wondershare Filmora. Filmora is an easy-to-use yet powerful enough video editing tool loaded with stunning effects, such as cartoons, sketches, color sketches, and more. The process is very easy to follow, and to use Filmora, you don't need to be a pro. Here are the steps that you can follow:

**Step 1:** Launch Wondershare Filmora to your Mac or Windows computer. If you haven’t downloaded it yet, click the Try It Free button below to start.

[![Download Filmora  Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora   Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

**Step 2:**  Now, import media files and load the video that you want to convert into a cartoon or anime to the media library, and then add that video to the timeline.

**Step 3:**  Go to the Effects option, and type sketch in the search effects bar, which will be on the top of the screen.

**Step 4:**  Currently, Filmora provides sketch and color sketch effects. Try each one of them to see which one works the best. If you want to add the filter to the entire video, just drag and drop the filter to the video, and it's done.

![add sketch filter to video in Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-sketch-effect-video.jpg)

**Step 5:**  Finally, click on the Export button after everything is done to save the edited video on your computer.

Note: If you want to add the sketch effect to the person only, you can use the Human Segmentation in AI Portrait. In this way, you can also try the Cartoon effect to see the result.

A great way to share specific memories with those not on the social platform, or even for those looking to make personalized and meaningful memoir collages for their friends and loved ones, there are plenty of ways to inconspicuously screenshot on Snapchat without the sender being made aware.

Becoming one of the most popular and highly favored Social Media platforms over the past several years, Snapchat is a great place to showcase 10-second snippets of your day-to-day life with your followers, friends, and family members. From selfies to shots of food, videos taken during nights on the town to holiday adventures, Snapchat is the perfect video and image-sharing platform for Social Media fans.

## How to screenshot on snapchat without stimulating a notification?

An incredible application that allows you to send and share videos and images with friends and followers, Snapchat is designed to help you stay connected in more ways than one. Featuring an anti-screenshot notification system that automatically notifies posters when a recipient or audience member screenshots a snap, it’s become increasingly harder to screenshot without being detected.

That being said, there are still plenty of other methods that offer a practical alternative to ensure you avoid that awkward automated notification.

#### Option 1. Use Another Phone or Mobile Device to Take Snapchat Screenshot

An easy and risk-free way to capture and store a specific snap with ease, utilizing another mobile device or camera is a great method that requires very little effort. Simply us a second phone, or a nearby tablet, to record the whole duration of the video or photo.

Although the quality of the recording won’t be as crisp and clear as it appears on the handheld, this is a reliable and fool-proof way to preserve those special snaps. From those video recordings, you should then be able to crop out the video or image you needed.

Missed it?

Why not take advantage of Snapchat’s “replay” mode to ensure you get the perfect shot – but be warned, posters also get notified of this too.

#### Option 2. Use the Built-In Screen Recoding Tool on iOS11

If you didn’t already know, there’s a built-in screen recording software within iOS11 that allows you to effectively capture and record snaps with ease. Lying within the Settings of any iPhone, follow these easy steps on how to live record your screen:

* Step 1: Head to Settings > Control Centre > Customize Controls
* Step 2: Locate the “Screen Recording” functionality
* Step 3: Select the small cross to add it to your Control Centre
* Step 4: To activate – Tap the icon with the 2 concentric circles to start recording. To complete a recording, simply tap the red bar that’s present at the top of the screen and select “End Recording”.

Although it’s not possible to start recording a snap whilst it’s already open, it’s best to start recording before you opt to open a specific message.

Please note: If you have updated to Snapchat version 10.17.5, the posters will be notified each and every time you initiate and capture a recording through the use of this built-in recorder.

#### Option 3. Use QuickTime Screen Capture on a Mac

A little more technical than simply using another mobile device to record a snap, using the QuickTime Player is an efficient and high-quality method for those looking to secretly store a snapchat post.

To start recording snaps, follow these simple steps:

* Step 1: Connect your iPhone to your Mac
* Step 2: Open the QuickTime Player application
* Step 3: Select **File > New Movie Recording** from the menu
* Step 4: Once loaded, simply hover the mouse beside the recording button. By clicking the small arrow, you’ll be provided with a range of different recording options
* Step 5: Select your Phone as the **Movie Recording Input**

Once connected, your Mac screen should now be mirroring your mobile device. Just like you would on your phone, simply hit record and head on over to the Snapchat application to begin recording.

#### Option 4. Use the Mirror Feature for Android

Similar to the use of QuickTime or the iOS11 Screen Recording software, Screen Mirroring is another effective method for capturing Snapchat screenshots without the poster being made aware. By connecting a HDMI cable to both your TV and laptop, or by accessing the “Screen Mirroring” application that’s often built-in to most Smart Phones and Android devices, it’s possible to mirror/cast the active screen on your device onto an external platform.

In doing so, you’re presented with the opportunity to utilize another device to record a playing snap or even share a recently received snap with other audience members that are present in the room.

#### Option 5. Delay the Snapchat Screenshot Notification

A method for those feeling a more confident or even for those that aren’t too bothered about their posters receiving a notification in the long run, this method is a great way to delay the arrival of that pop-down notification.

To delay the notification process, follow these simple steps:

* Step 1: Load the Snapchat application on your mobile device
* Step 2: Find the snap you want to open/record (ensure it is fully loaded)
* Step 3: Turn off WiFi, Bluetooth, Mobile Data
* Step 4: Turn on the Airplane Mode
* Step 5: Open the snap and take your screenshot
* Step 6: Wait approximately 30 seconds and then turn all your connections back on

Designed to postpone the process of the poster receiving a notification, but not allowing for viewers to screenshot undetected, this method allows audience members to screenshot snaps from those that are perhaps a little unobservant when it comes to checking their notifications.

Be warned though, some posters may catch on to this method of screenshotting and they may stop sharing their videos and images with you.

## Summary

Despite there being plenty of reasons why there might be a need for you to record a Snapchat memory without the sender being made aware, it’s important to note that this can also be viewed as a breach of privacy with senders not only being informed of who has taken a screenshot, but also how many times they’ve done so and of which post.

With Snapchat designed to maintain the notion that any media sent between users is considered temporary, thanks to the 5-10 second duration limit, the methods listed above, although not fail-proof, are suggested as simple yet effective ways to avoid triggering an unwanted notification whilst using this highly popular social networking application.

A great way to share specific memories with those not on the social platform, or even for those looking to make personalized and meaningful memoir collages for their friends and loved ones, there are plenty of ways to inconspicuously screenshot on Snapchat without the sender being made aware.

Becoming one of the most popular and highly favored Social Media platforms over the past several years, Snapchat is a great place to showcase 10-second snippets of your day-to-day life with your followers, friends, and family members. From selfies to shots of food, videos taken during nights on the town to holiday adventures, Snapchat is the perfect video and image-sharing platform for Social Media fans.

## How to screenshot on snapchat without stimulating a notification?

An incredible application that allows you to send and share videos and images with friends and followers, Snapchat is designed to help you stay connected in more ways than one. Featuring an anti-screenshot notification system that automatically notifies posters when a recipient or audience member screenshots a snap, it’s become increasingly harder to screenshot without being detected.

That being said, there are still plenty of other methods that offer a practical alternative to ensure you avoid that awkward automated notification.

#### Option 1. Use Another Phone or Mobile Device to Take Snapchat Screenshot

An easy and risk-free way to capture and store a specific snap with ease, utilizing another mobile device or camera is a great method that requires very little effort. Simply us a second phone, or a nearby tablet, to record the whole duration of the video or photo.

Although the quality of the recording won’t be as crisp and clear as it appears on the handheld, this is a reliable and fool-proof way to preserve those special snaps. From those video recordings, you should then be able to crop out the video or image you needed.

Missed it?

Why not take advantage of Snapchat’s “replay” mode to ensure you get the perfect shot – but be warned, posters also get notified of this too.

#### Option 2. Use the Built-In Screen Recoding Tool on iOS11

If you didn’t already know, there’s a built-in screen recording software within iOS11 that allows you to effectively capture and record snaps with ease. Lying within the Settings of any iPhone, follow these easy steps on how to live record your screen:

* Step 1: Head to Settings > Control Centre > Customize Controls
* Step 2: Locate the “Screen Recording” functionality
* Step 3: Select the small cross to add it to your Control Centre
* Step 4: To activate – Tap the icon with the 2 concentric circles to start recording. To complete a recording, simply tap the red bar that’s present at the top of the screen and select “End Recording”.

Although it’s not possible to start recording a snap whilst it’s already open, it’s best to start recording before you opt to open a specific message.

Please note: If you have updated to Snapchat version 10.17.5, the posters will be notified each and every time you initiate and capture a recording through the use of this built-in recorder.

#### Option 3. Use QuickTime Screen Capture on a Mac

A little more technical than simply using another mobile device to record a snap, using the QuickTime Player is an efficient and high-quality method for those looking to secretly store a snapchat post.

To start recording snaps, follow these simple steps:

* Step 1: Connect your iPhone to your Mac
* Step 2: Open the QuickTime Player application
* Step 3: Select **File > New Movie Recording** from the menu
* Step 4: Once loaded, simply hover the mouse beside the recording button. By clicking the small arrow, you’ll be provided with a range of different recording options
* Step 5: Select your Phone as the **Movie Recording Input**

Once connected, your Mac screen should now be mirroring your mobile device. Just like you would on your phone, simply hit record and head on over to the Snapchat application to begin recording.

#### Option 4. Use the Mirror Feature for Android

Similar to the use of QuickTime or the iOS11 Screen Recording software, Screen Mirroring is another effective method for capturing Snapchat screenshots without the poster being made aware. By connecting a HDMI cable to both your TV and laptop, or by accessing the “Screen Mirroring” application that’s often built-in to most Smart Phones and Android devices, it’s possible to mirror/cast the active screen on your device onto an external platform.

In doing so, you’re presented with the opportunity to utilize another device to record a playing snap or even share a recently received snap with other audience members that are present in the room.

#### Option 5. Delay the Snapchat Screenshot Notification

A method for those feeling a more confident or even for those that aren’t too bothered about their posters receiving a notification in the long run, this method is a great way to delay the arrival of that pop-down notification.

To delay the notification process, follow these simple steps:

* Step 1: Load the Snapchat application on your mobile device
* Step 2: Find the snap you want to open/record (ensure it is fully loaded)
* Step 3: Turn off WiFi, Bluetooth, Mobile Data
* Step 4: Turn on the Airplane Mode
* Step 5: Open the snap and take your screenshot
* Step 6: Wait approximately 30 seconds and then turn all your connections back on

Designed to postpone the process of the poster receiving a notification, but not allowing for viewers to screenshot undetected, this method allows audience members to screenshot snaps from those that are perhaps a little unobservant when it comes to checking their notifications.

Be warned though, some posters may catch on to this method of screenshotting and they may stop sharing their videos and images with you.

## Summary

Despite there being plenty of reasons why there might be a need for you to record a Snapchat memory without the sender being made aware, it’s important to note that this can also be viewed as a breach of privacy with senders not only being informed of who has taken a screenshot, but also how many times they’ve done so and of which post.

With Snapchat designed to maintain the notion that any media sent between users is considered temporary, thanks to the 5-10 second duration limit, the methods listed above, although not fail-proof, are suggested as simple yet effective ways to avoid triggering an unwanted notification whilst using this highly popular social networking application.
