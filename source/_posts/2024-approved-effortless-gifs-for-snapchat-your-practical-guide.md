![snapchat-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snapchat-poster.png)

For all informal interactions between pals, Snapchat is the go-to app. Many configurable options are available on the platform, allowing you to express your inner creative sides. Snapchat helps to put your spin on anything, whether it's just sharing random photos to your contacts or having extended chats.

The option to add GIFs to Snapchat is one such great feature. Because Snapchat is primarily a picture-sharing app, the emphasis is on making these images as engaging and imaginative as possible, and this is where animated GIFs come to play.

GIF stickers have exploded in popularity and for a good cause. The active emojis are mostly not amusing, but they also give life to your images, making your digital experience better overall.

Given how entertaining GIFs can be, knowing how to send gif on snapchat is essential. As a result, we've put up a detailed guide that explains how to send gif on snapchat in four distinct methods. Enjoy!

That GIF has now been saved to your pictures folder and can be seen anytime you need that.

### Switching off the Internet Connection

The first method revolves around disabling the internet connection of your device. For starters, reload and refresh your Snapchat feed. Disconnect the Wi-Fi or data network, and then screen records the snap. It helps you get the task done without getting noticed, as the app doesn’t know what is happening without internet connectivity.

### Enabling the Airplane Mode

One workable method is to enable the Airplane Mode before you plan to screen record Snapchat. What happens is that the app doesn’t respond to the operation occurring as Airplane Mode is switched on. The process doesn’t send the notification to the targeted person; thus, it always works.

### Using a Third-Party Software

You can access the [third-party screen recorder](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and then perform screen recording on Snapchat. The market offers numerous apps for a similar reason. Their usage is simple as well.

### Mirroring Phone on PC

Another tricky method revolves around mirroring phones on PC. The Snapchat user can connect the device to the computer and then play the snap story. As Snapchat cannot read the computer’s activities, you can use the recorder to screen record Snapchat stories in seconds.

### Using Another Phone

You can pick a phone of your sibling or a friend to record the snaps of the targeted person. It might not be a high-resolution output, but it would surely get your task done without getting noticed.
