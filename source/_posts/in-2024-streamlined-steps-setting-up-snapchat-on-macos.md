#### 2.Whaaa eeh??

The perfect snap sticker that relates to our blank situation on a whole new level is this one. People find this sticker quite laughable when used in awkwardly witty cases. Don't get someone's waggish accent but also not wanna feel silly; use this sticker to your benefit.

#### 3.Spill the dirt

Hands down, one of the best Snapchat stickers of all time is this one. See that smile; that smile will tell you all. This quirky Snapchat sticker represents a gossip session you know will be lit before it is even spilled. Through this sticker in your buddy's Snapchat inbox to let them know you're all set to spill the dirt.

#### 4.To meme or not to meme

Mamma-Mia I love this sticker personally. This funny Snapchat sticker was made to represent a poor Shakespeare pun. You can use this sticker in your snaps to cover up after making a joke so terrible; your friends might throw you out of the window.

#### 5.You ma QUEEN

A funny yet adorable Snapchat sticker that represents most love situations perfectly is this one. A single text from your queen and your mind hops on to create romantic scenarios (that are probably never happening). But what can happen is that you can make your honeybunch feel special by sending them this cute snap sticker.

#### 6.It's all good

This ironic Snapchat sticker best represents a situation when you're trying to keep your head above water. Use this sticker on your snap to describe your condition when a social media friend inquires about you.

![All Good Sticker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/all-good-sticker.jpg)

#### 7.What the behavior dude

Get your Snapchat fam crack up your snap with this super funny Snapchat sticker. For me, it represents a ludicrous situation; most of us end up in daily. Like when you ask for a new shampoo bottle while showering, only to get back the same bottle filled with water.

![Behavior Snapchat Sticker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/behavior-snapchat-sticker.jpg)

#### 8.Your smug smile

The jerry in this Snapchat sticker portrays that one friend in every squad who considers himself the "smart soul." If you're that friend among your team, you will love to use this sticker to show your smug smile every time you put forward your smartness.

#### 9.No offense, but that was pathetic

That face you make when someone cracks a joke so LAME, you just can't take it. It looks like this Snapchat sticker was created to match our Yikes face. Take advantage of this funny Snapchat sticker and tell someone their joke was pretty pathetic without making them angry.

![Pathetic Snapchat Sticker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pathetic-snapchat-sticker.jpg)

#### 10\. I'm not crying; you're crying

One of the best Snapchat stickers, I believe. It comes from those adorable situations when you're overwhelmed and just can't control your tears (certainly the tears of joy). Imagine your friend sent you a "100 reasons why I love you" text, and it got you awestruck. You won't find a sticker better than this to shower your friend with.

![Crying Snapchat Sticker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/crying-snapchat-sticker.jpg)

Pro-tip: Dive into your Snapchat, snap a photo, add one of these hilarious snap stickers, draw over or customize the snap. And Voila, you just created a SNAPSTERPIECE.
