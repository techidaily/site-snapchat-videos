## Part 1\. Snapchat Overview

Firstly, let's have an overview of Snapchat before we see how to draw your blueprint in Part 3 and Part 4.

Snapchat - founded by Evan Spiegel, Bobby Murphy, and Reggie Brown - is a unique messaging app because it allows users to send disappearing messages and photos. This feature has made the app popular with young people aged 13-34 who want to communicate without leaving a permanent record.

As of May 2022, Snapchat has [347 million daily active users.](https://www.statista.com/statistics/545967/snapchat-app-dau/#:~:text=How%20many%20daily%20active%20users,increase%20of%20over%2018%20percent.) That's impressive growth from its humble beginnings back in 2011\. With [monthly active users of 557](https://www.statista.com/statistics/272014/global-social-networks-ranked-by-number-of-users/), Snapchat is ranked as the 12th most popular social media platform.

Not only that, the number of [Snapchat daily video views is 18 billion,](https://www.omnicoreagency.com/snapchat-statistics/) making it the best platform to showcase your services/products and generate more income. However, all this is only possible with the right **Snapchat marketing strategy.**

## Part 2\. Why Should Business Market On Snapchat

So you are probably thinking why your business should be on Snapchat - because it's popular with teenagers and young adults. In fact, the platform has over 347 million daily active users, with **75%** being under the age of 34.

Therefore, if you're targeting a younger demographic, then Snapchat should definitely be part of your social media marketing strategy.

Another big reason is that Snapchat is incredibly engaging. The average Snapchat user opens the app at least 20 times a day and spends 25 - 30 minutes on the app each day, so that's a lot of potential exposure for your business.

Not only that, but since Snapchat is still a new field and opened up [ads to users in October 2014,](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/20/snapchat-messaging-app-ad-creepy-ouija) many big companies have not entered the market. This has created a huge opportunity for small businesses to market their products and generate leads to increase their sales.

With Snapchat, you can get discovered by users in their Discovery feeds or via Stories. Also, they can interact with your brand using the Geofilters, stickers, and lenses you've produced during your ad campaign.

For instance, Taco Bell created a filter for Cinco de Mayo. The filter received 224 Million views, which is insane. Nevertheless, this campaign kept users engaged and helped increase Taco Bell's sales.
