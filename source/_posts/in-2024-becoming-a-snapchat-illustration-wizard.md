To Distinguish the difference between Snapchat filters and lenses: Snapchat filters are static and located on top of images or videos. On the other hand, Snapchat lenses are augmented reality animations that can change your voice in addition to changing your appearance on the screen.

**Conclusion**

Snapchat is primarily known for its lens and filters. Many other apps even try to copy the filers but certainly couldn’t make it up. To develop the longest streak with your friends, you need to use Snapchat daily. Hence, Snapchat would never get you bored if you have to use it and send a snap with the cartoon face lens daily to friends. The regularly updating lens and the streak will keep you engaged in it every day. The app does not demand much high configuration and high storage. Hence, the app can fit into any individual and is easy to operate.
