**Snapchat** is one of the most popular social media platforms of the present time and certainly needs no introduction. Though, to rival other apps like Instagram and TikTok, Snapchat has recently added a “Sound” feature. With this newly-added option, users can add music to a Snapchat video pretty easily and make their snaps more interesting. In this post, I’m going to let you know how to add music to a Snapchat video without any hassle. Let’s get it started and level-up your Snapchat game!

## Part 1: What's the Sound Feature in Snapchat?

Before we learn how to add music to your Snapchat video, let’s quickly get to know about the “Sounds” feature of the app. If you have been using Instagram or TikTok, then you might be familiar with their music feature.

Similarly, in 2020, Snapchat has also included a Sound feature that lets us add music to our snaps (photos or videos). For this, you can integrate Snapchat with a streaming service like Spotify, Pandora, Apple Music, or Soundcloud. While it doesn’t include all sorts of tracks, you can find most of the popular songs so that you can easily add music to a Snapchat video and make it interesting.

Once the other person would view your snap, they can hear the music playing in the background. If they want to listen to it or know more about the song, then they can just tap on its sticker on your snap.

## Part 2: How to Add Music to a Snapchat Video on iPhone or Android?

One of the best things about Snapchat is that the overall interface of the app is pretty similar for both iOS and Android versions. Therefore, to learn how to add music on a Snapchat video, you need to follow the same process. As of now, you can find almost all the popular songs on Snapchat and can even record your own sounds.

To learn how to add music to your Snapchat video on your Android or iOS device, you can just follow this simple drill.

**Step 1: Visit the Snapchat Sound section on the app**

At first, just launch the Snapchat application on your device and tap on the camera icon from the home to start recording.

Using the rear or front camera of your device, you can now record any video on Snapchat. Once the video is recorded, you can tap on the music icon from the sidebar to add a song to a Snapchat video.

**Step 2: Search for any music to include in your Snaps**

As you would tap on the **Music** icon, you can view a list of various songs supported by Snapchat. If you want to look for anything specific, then just tap on the search icon and enter keywords to find a song of your choice.

Afterward, Snapchat will list the searched results, and you can tap on the play icon to first listen to the song. Just tap on the icon of the song and click on the “Next” button from the bottom to include it in the snap.

**Step 3: Trim and add the song to your Snapchat video**

Now, Snapchat will automatically display the snippet of the music at the bottom. You can use the left or the right slider option to trim the section of the music you want to add. Here, you also can tap on the play icon to listen to the track first.

**Step 4: Add music to your Snapchat video after recording**

That’s it! Once you have trimmed the music snippet, you can post it. You can tap on the shutter or the download icon first to save the video on your phone.

Now, you can preview the music via its sticker. You can just tap on the music sticker to change its appearance or drag it on the screen to place it anywhere you like. To change its size, you can just pinch-in or pinch-out the sticker.

In the end, just tap on the send icon to post your snap. You can add it to your story or sent it to any Snapchat contact. When they would open it, they can listen to the added song and even tap on the sticker to load it.

In this way, anyone can learn how to put music on a Snapchat video without any hassle.

## Part 3: FAQs on Adding Music to a Snapchat Video

Now when you know how to add music to your Snapchat video, let’s clear some common doubts related to it.

* **Why are some songs not available on Snapchat?**

The Sound feature of Snapchat only provides licensed music by collaborating with some of the biggest record labels. Therefore, while you can find most of the popular songs, chances are that some of them might be missing from the collection.

* **Why can’t I add music to my Snapchat videos?**

Well, there could be two possible reasons for this – you might be using an old version of Snapchat or the feature might not be available in your region yet. To fix this, you can just go to the Snapchat page on the App/Play Store and tap on the “Update” button. Furthermore, if the Sound feature has not been rolled out to your region, then you can just wait for a while.

## Leveraging Snapchat for Professional Networking & Sales

As one of the most popular social platforms, Snapchat provides a wealth of opportunities for businesses to promote their products and services. However, Snapchat marketing can be challenging, as the platform constantly evolves and changes.

This article provides an overview of **Snapchat marketing strategy,** including why businesses should market on this platform, what types of content to post, and how to measure results.

With the information available in this article, you will be able to create a strategy that works for your business and get succeeded.

![snapchat app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/snapchat-app.jpg)

## Part 1\. Snapchat Overview

Firstly, let's have an overview of Snapchat before we see how to draw your blueprint in Part 3 and Part 4.

Snapchat - founded by Evan Spiegel, Bobby Murphy, and Reggie Brown - is a unique messaging app because it allows users to send disappearing messages and photos. This feature has made the app popular with young people aged 13-34 who want to communicate without leaving a permanent record.

As of May 2022, Snapchat has [347 million daily active users.](https://www.statista.com/statistics/545967/snapchat-app-dau/#:~:text=How%20many%20daily%20active%20users,increase%20of%20over%2018%20percent.) That's impressive growth from its humble beginnings back in 2011\. With [monthly active users of 557](https://www.statista.com/statistics/272014/global-social-networks-ranked-by-number-of-users/), Snapchat is ranked as the 12th most popular social media platform.

Not only that, the number of [Snapchat daily video views is 18 billion,](https://www.omnicoreagency.com/snapchat-statistics/) making it the best platform to showcase your services/products and generate more income. However, all this is only possible with the right **Snapchat marketing strategy.**

## Part 2\. Why Should Business Market On Snapchat

So you are probably thinking why your business should be on Snapchat - because it's popular with teenagers and young adults. In fact, the platform has over 347 million daily active users, with **75%** being under the age of 34.

Therefore, if you're targeting a younger demographic, then Snapchat should definitely be part of your social media marketing strategy.

Another big reason is that Snapchat is incredibly engaging. The average Snapchat user opens the app at least 20 times a day and spends 25 - 30 minutes on the app each day, so that's a lot of potential exposure for your business.

Not only that, but since Snapchat is still a new field and opened up [ads to users in October 2014,](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/20/snapchat-messaging-app-ad-creepy-ouija) many big companies have not entered the market. This has created a huge opportunity for small businesses to market their products and generate leads to increase their sales.

With Snapchat, you can get discovered by users in their Discovery feeds or via Stories. Also, they can interact with your brand using the Geofilters, stickers, and lenses you've produced during your ad campaign.

For instance, Taco Bell created a filter for Cinco de Mayo. The filter received 224 Million views, which is insane. Nevertheless, this campaign kept users engaged and helped increase Taco Bell's sales.

Here are a few tips and approaches to help you create a Snapchat story that will capture your audience's attention:

* **Keep it short and sweet:** Snapchat stories are only 10 seconds long, so make sure your story is concise and to the point.
* **Use high-quality visuals:** Since Snapchat is all about visuals, use high-quality images and videos in your story.
* **Be creative**: Use Snapchat's unique features, such as filters and augmented reality, to create a story that is truly one of a kind.

### How To Advertise With Snapchat

Snapchat Ads are a form of advertisement that allows businesses to reach out to Snapchat users with creative and interactive content. These ads can take the form of filters, lenses, or Geofilters and can be targeted to specific users based on their interests and location.

Snapchat ads are a great way to reach a new audience and promote your business in a fun and engaging way. To learn how to create stunning and effective Snapchat ads, please read[Snapchat Ad 101](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

### Sponsored Geofilters

Geofilters are location-specific AR filters that you can create on-demand for your business to attract more customers. These filters can cost you **$5 to $20** depending upon the area/ square feet and duration, but they will surely help you attract more customers, resulting in more revenue.

### Sponsored Lenses

Sponsored lenses are AR filters businesses produce to interact with their users on Snapchat. Users can use these lenses to make inspiring snaps, send them to friends or have fun playing games using the gamified lenses.

For instance, Sephora created a gamified AR experience for their advertisement campaign on Snapchat. They provide coupons and promo codes to the users who completed the game. This helped them boost their products' sales and ultimately generate more sales.

### Snapchat Discover

Snapchat Discover is a feature that helps brands to publish stories on the Snapchat app. This content is designed to be consumed in short, snackable bites - perfect for the attention-deficient millennial.

### Track and Measure your Marketing Results

You've created a Snapchat marketing strategy and are ready to start reaching your target audience. But how will you monitor if your marketing efforts are successful? The key is to track and measure your results so that you can make adjustments as needed.

While Snapchat doesn't offer robust analytics data, you can track the following metrics to monitor the results:

* By checking the number of views on your stories and ads to see how many people are viewing them.
* Check the length of the Story that received more viewers and try to make future ads and stories of the same length.
* Monitor the number of views on your First Snap and Last Snap and check whether the views are increasing or not.
* Analyze Engagement (the number of screenshots or direct messages) on your ads and stories. This will clearly tell you about your performance.
* Check the completion Rate (percentage of users who watched your stories and compare it with the increase in sales to see whether you are performing well or not.

* **Keep it short and sweet:** Snapchat stories are only 10 seconds long, so make sure your story is concise and to the point.
* **Use high-quality visuals:** Since Snapchat is all about visuals, use high-quality images and videos in your story.
* **Be creative**: Use Snapchat's unique features, such as filters and augmented reality, to create a story that is truly one of a kind.
