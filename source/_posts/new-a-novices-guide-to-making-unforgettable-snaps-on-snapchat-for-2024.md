 There are 3 options to respond to a call.

1. If they click on âWatchâ option, they can see you, but you arenât allowed for so.
2. If they tap âJoinâ option, it means both of you can see and talk to each other. In case they select âIgnoreâ option, you will get a busy message.
3. If you tap the green camera icon the video becomes one way, where only you can see them, but they wonât see you.

 Note: By swiping the screen down, you can minimize the Snapchat video call.
