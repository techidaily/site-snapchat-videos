To Distinguish the difference between Snapchat filters and lenses: Snapchat filters are static and located on top of images or videos. On the other hand, Snapchat lenses are augmented reality animations that can change your voice in addition to changing your appearance on the screen.

**Conclusion**

Snapchat is primarily known for its lens and filters. Many other apps even try to copy the filers but certainly couldn’t make it up. To develop the longest streak with your friends, you need to use Snapchat daily. Hence, Snapchat would never get you bored if you have to use it and send a snap with the cartoon face lens daily to friends. The regularly updating lens and the streak will keep you engaged in it every day. The app does not demand much high configuration and high storage. Hence, the app can fit into any individual and is easy to operate.

## What Are the Ideal Features of a Snapchat Video?

Snapchat is highly optimized for vertical viewing which means that all the content needs to be served in portrait aspect ratio instead of landscape used by YouTube and other video platforms. You need to ensure that every aspect of your video is perfect before you can upload it for Snapchat on Mac. Here are some of the key features that you must not forget.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/snapchat.jpg)

* **Resolution** \- The ideal resolution of a Snapchat video is **1080 x 1920** pixels which is known as full HD. This resolution will ensure that your video loads in the right way and remains sharp and crisp for an excellent viewing experience.
* **Video Format** \- The recommended video format for Snapchat clips is **MP4 and MOV. Y**ou can use either of those formats on your Mac.
* **Aspect Ratio** \- This is one of the key aspects of any video that determines the orientation of viewing. For a perfect Snapchat video, it is recommended that you keep the aspect ratio to **9:16**.
* **Video Length Size** \- Remember that Snapchat isn't like YouTube and serves an audience that wants micro-entertainment. This is why the recommended time for your video is **3 to 10 seconds** with the video size **not exceeding 32 MB**. Otherwise, the Snapchat audience may not respond well to your videos.

That is why it is crucial that your Snapchat video has all the ideal features so your audience can enjoy the viewing experience as intended instead of attempting to manipulate their phones to be able to see the video clearly. It will create an unpleasant and frustrating experience and your viewers might not stay with you.

### Part3\. Changing Snapchat Video Size on Filmora

1. Importing Media File to Filmora

Using the 'Import' menu, import your media files, or simply drag and drop them from your Mac OS. Once the files are in the software, drag them to the Timeline track.

2. Cropping Your Video for Snapchat

Here you can use the 'Crop and Zoom' button from the Timeline by right-clicking on it, so you can only focus on the aspect of the video that you want to show. This will resize the video as well.

3. Cutting the Video

Another option you have is to delete the unnecessary parts of the video by selecting them through the indicator present on the timeline. Once you have selected the parts you don't need, right-click on them and select 'Delete'.

4. Exporting Your Snapchat Video

Once you have resized your video by cropping and cutting the media file, you can now export it in the right resolution, bit rate, and format to ensure you get the minimum file size.
