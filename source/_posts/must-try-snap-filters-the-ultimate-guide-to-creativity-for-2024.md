## Part 1: Most Popular Snapchat Filters for Selfies in 2021

**Let's have a look at the most popular Snapchat filters for selfies as we all know there's a big range to choose from!**

#### 1\.  Fire Sunglasses

Whenever the users are feeling energetic and motivated, they use the "fire sunglasses" filter. They want to show everyone that they're on fire, and there couldn't be a better filter than this. It provides the users with a pair of glasses with fire on the glass, which adds to the energy.

The fire on the contacts gives you a fiery and relaxed look that catches people's attention. People can use it after their workouts or for motivational posts. This filter puts up an uplifting mood and gives you good vibes, but it might not be best suited for everyone.

#### 2\.  Neon Horns

The Classic filter, the devil's horn but in neon! Incredibly catchy to the eye and gives you a devilish look. This filter is a classic and is here to stay for a long time; there's no doubt in that.

For the first time, Horn Filters have taken one step further and given it a neon effect, making it even more appealing. The user can change the horn color; various options have been offered, such as black and white. Some more color options include lime green, magenta, orange, and light blue. It is an evergreen filter but has limited use. Want to know the best part? It sits perfectly according to your filter and does not glitch at all.
