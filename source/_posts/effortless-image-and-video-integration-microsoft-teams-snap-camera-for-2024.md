Whether you're a blogger, a small business owner, or just someone who likes to create content, unique presenting ways can help you stand out on Snapchat.

If you're creating a Snapchat story that is longer than the standard 10 seconds, you can use title cards to help keep your viewers engaged.

Title cards are simply images with the text you can insert into your story to help identify what's coming next. For example, if you're sharing a story about your company's history, you could use a title card at the beginning of each section to identify the different parts of the story.

For this, you can take a snap of a wall or perhaps block your camera to get a black screen and then paste your text on the picture. You can also play with the font size, style, or color to create engaging title cards.

### Idea 2\. Use Short Links

Since you cannot add clickable links to your snaps, using a shortened URL is an excellent approach to help people follow up on your links.

To get started, you need to find a URL shortener service such as [bitly.com](https://bitly.com/) and then begin sharing your shortened URLs with your Snapchat followers. You can add them to your snaps or post them in your story.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Idea 3\. Sneak Peeks Of New Products

Giving your followers/customers a sneak peek of new products before they hit the shelves can excite them about your brand. This not only builds anticipation and excitement but also gives your fans a chance to be the first to know how and when to get their hands on your new products.

You can provide sneak peeks of new products on Snapchat in a number of ways. For instance, you can give short previews or teasers of products in your upcoming collection or first look at new products. You can even use Snapchat to give your fans a behind-the-scenes look at how your products are made.

Whatever approach you take, ensure that you're providing value to your audience. They should feel like they're getting something special by having a sneak peek of your new products.

### Idea 4\. Attach Your Username, Username URL, Or Snapchat Code

To get more audiences and followers on Snapchat, you can also try attaching your username, username URL, or Snapcode to your stories. These three approaches can help your customers find your account or add you as a friend on Snapchat.

To share your Snapchat username URL, open **Snapchat** and click your **Profile** icon. Tap on your **yellow Snapcode** to access more options. Tap **"Share My Profile Link"** and select the platform you want to share it with.

To share your Snapcode, simply let others scan the code via their phone's camera or tap **"Profile > Snapcode icon > Share Snapcode."**

As a business, you always want to look for new ways to reach your target audience. With Snapchat being the 12th most popular social media platform today, it's definitely worth considering running ads on Snapchat.

* To make an ever-lasting impression on the viewers.
* To target a specific location or people of a certain age, hobbies, and other interests.
* To help you increase your exposure and grow your sale.

### Idea 2\. Coupon

You can quickly promote your business on Snapchat by offering coupons and use them to encourage customers to make a purchase or as loyalty rewards for existing customers.

Here's a quick guide on how to create coupons and increase your sale:

Step1 Choose the type of coupon you want to create, i.e., a code or a task.

Step2 Next, open the Snapchat app on your device, and create or choose an image/video for your coupon. Make sure it's captivating and related to the theme.

Step3 Add the coupon code or task to the Snap and share your coupon with your followers via your Stories.

### Idea 3\. Host A Contest Or Giveaway

You can also promote your business/brand on Snapchat by hosting a contest or giveaway. This can help you not only reach more people but also get them talking about your brand.

People love free products, so if you're giving away prizes, you can bet that they will be eager to follow you.

![content on snapchat](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/content-on-snapchat.jpg)

Such contests can also generate interest and excitement about your brand and can help your build relationships with your followers. By interacting with people and giving them a chance to win something, you're showing that you care about them.

## Part 4\. A Bonus Tip: Tracking and Analysing Snap Stats

Tracking and analyzing your snap stats can be difficult, but it's also important to do if you want to be successful on Snapchat. By understanding your snap stats, you can figure out what works and doesn't and adjust your Snapchat strategy accordingly.

So what stats should you be tracking on Snapchat? Here are a few of the most important ones:

* **Views:** This is a good metric to track if you want to see how many people are actually seeing your content. Keep an eye on your views over time to see if you're getting more or less engagement.
* **Screenshots:** Screenshots can be a good indicator of how viral your content is. If you're getting a lot of screenshots, it means people are sharing your content with others.
* **New Followers:** This will help you understand how effective your Snapchat marketing efforts are.
* **The Timing Of Your Snaps:** This will help you understand when your audience is most engaged and when they're most likely to see your snaps.
