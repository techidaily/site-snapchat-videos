#### Face Swap

Have you tried this nightmarish filter yet? If you are a fantasy lover and love to try stuffs straight out of dreams, then try this filter with a friend. The smart technology in this filter swaps your face with the friend in frame with you. Your face gets masked on your friend’s face, and vise-a-versa.

#### Flower Crown

We personally are in awe with this beautiful filter from Snapchat. One of the best Snapchat filters, that adorned Snapchat stories and profile pictures of other social media sites as well. This basic filter from Snapchat makes your skin look flawless, adding an instant glow to your picture and enhancing your eyes. The floral crown does the added magical effect to your looks. Like the Puppy filter, you can share screen with your BFF and pose as the flower angels.

#### Bearded Filters

This filter is really funny for people without beard, more fun for the ladies. Pose as a beard pirate with that mysterious stubble and moustache and up the fun quotient.
