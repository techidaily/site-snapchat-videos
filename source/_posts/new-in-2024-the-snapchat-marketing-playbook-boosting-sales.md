## Part 1\. Snapchat Overview

Firstly, let's have an overview of Snapchat before we see how to draw your blueprint in Part 3 and Part 4.

Snapchat - founded by Evan Spiegel, Bobby Murphy, and Reggie Brown - is a unique messaging app because it allows users to send disappearing messages and photos. This feature has made the app popular with young people aged 13-34 who want to communicate without leaving a permanent record.

As of May 2022, Snapchat has [347 million daily active users.](https://www.statista.com/statistics/545967/snapchat-app-dau/#:~:text=How%20many%20daily%20active%20users,increase%20of%20over%2018%20percent.) That's impressive growth from its humble beginnings back in 2011\. With [monthly active users of 557](https://www.statista.com/statistics/272014/global-social-networks-ranked-by-number-of-users/), Snapchat is ranked as the 12th most popular social media platform.

Not only that, the number of [Snapchat daily video views is 18 billion,](https://www.omnicoreagency.com/snapchat-statistics/) making it the best platform to showcase your services/products and generate more income. However, all this is only possible with the right **Snapchat marketing strategy.**

## Part 2\. Why Should Business Market On Snapchat

So you are probably thinking why your business should be on Snapchat - because it's popular with teenagers and young adults. In fact, the platform has over 347 million daily active users, with **75%** being under the age of 34.

Therefore, if you're targeting a younger demographic, then Snapchat should definitely be part of your social media marketing strategy.

Another big reason is that Snapchat is incredibly engaging. The average Snapchat user opens the app at least 20 times a day and spends 25 - 30 minutes on the app each day, so that's a lot of potential exposure for your business.

Not only that, but since Snapchat is still a new field and opened up [ads to users in October 2014,](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/20/snapchat-messaging-app-ad-creepy-ouija) many big companies have not entered the market. This has created a huge opportunity for small businesses to market their products and generate leads to increase their sales.

With Snapchat, you can get discovered by users in their Discovery feeds or via Stories. Also, they can interact with your brand using the Geofilters, stickers, and lenses you've produced during your ad campaign.

For instance, Taco Bell created a filter for Cinco de Mayo. The filter received 224 Million views, which is insane. Nevertheless, this campaign kept users engaged and helped increase Taco Bell's sales.

**Snapchat** is one of the most popular social media platforms of the present time and certainly needs no introduction. Though, to rival other apps like Instagram and TikTok, Snapchat has recently added a “Sound” feature. With this newly-added option, users can add music to a Snapchat video pretty easily and make their snaps more interesting. In this post, I’m going to let you know how to add music to a Snapchat video without any hassle. Let’s get it started and level-up your Snapchat game!

## Part 1: What's the Sound Feature in Snapchat?

Before we learn how to add music to your Snapchat video, let’s quickly get to know about the “Sounds” feature of the app. If you have been using Instagram or TikTok, then you might be familiar with their music feature.

Similarly, in 2020, Snapchat has also included a Sound feature that lets us add music to our snaps (photos or videos). For this, you can integrate Snapchat with a streaming service like Spotify, Pandora, Apple Music, or Soundcloud. While it doesn’t include all sorts of tracks, you can find most of the popular songs so that you can easily add music to a Snapchat video and make it interesting.

Once the other person would view your snap, they can hear the music playing in the background. If they want to listen to it or know more about the song, then they can just tap on its sticker on your snap.

Now, you can preview the music via its sticker. You can just tap on the music sticker to change its appearance or drag it on the screen to place it anywhere you like. To change its size, you can just pinch-in or pinch-out the sticker.

In the end, just tap on the send icon to post your snap. You can add it to your story or sent it to any Snapchat contact. When they would open it, they can listen to the added song and even tap on the sticker to load it.

## Part 3: FAQs on Adding Music to a Snapchat Video

Now when you know how to add music to your Snapchat video, let’s clear some common doubts related to it.

* **How to add your own music to a Snapchat video?**

Apart from the available songs on Snapchat, the app also lets us add the sound of our choice. For this, just click on the music icon and tap the “Create Sound” button instead. This will let you record anything or create your own music on Snapchat.

* **Why are some songs not available on Snapchat?**

The Sound feature of Snapchat only provides licensed music by collaborating with some of the biggest record labels. Therefore, while you can find most of the popular songs, chances are that some of them might be missing from the collection.

* **Why can’t I add music to my Snapchat videos?**

Well, there could be two possible reasons for this – you might be using an old version of Snapchat or the feature might not be available in your region yet. To fix this, you can just go to the Snapchat page on the App/Play Store and tap on the “Update” button. Furthermore, if the Sound feature has not been rolled out to your region, then you can just wait for a while.

As you can see, it is pretty easy to learn how to add music to a Snapchat video like a pro. With the newly-added Sounds feature, it is pretty easy to add a song to your Snapchat videos and make them more interesting. Go ahead and try this feature to make your snaps creative and share this guide with others to teach them how do you add music to a Snapchat video as well.
