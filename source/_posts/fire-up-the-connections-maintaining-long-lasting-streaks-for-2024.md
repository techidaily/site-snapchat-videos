* **Memories**: Any picture from your Memories vault will not be considered a Snapstreak.
* **Group Chat:** Group chats, whether text-based or Snaps, do not contribute to a Streak.
* **Snapchat Spectacle:** Any snap sent through Snapchat spectacle won't be considered a Snapstreak interaction.

### Tip 3\. Organize Your Snapchat And Your Time

Are you trying to get the most out of Snapchat without letting it take over your life? Below we've provided some ideas to help you organize your time and your snaps.

**Idea 1\. Edit the Name of your Snapchat Friends**

To avoid losing your Snapchat streaks with any of your contacts, you should start editing their names. Snapchat lists your most contacted friends at the top, so you might not see the others who are lower on your list. Editing their names to include something that will help you search for them will make it easier to avoid forgetting to send them a snap regularly.

![edit the name of your snapchat friend](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/edit-the-name-of-your-snapchat-friend.jpg)

**Idea 2\. Pin Your Conversations**

If you want to keep someone at the top of your chat list, consider pinning their chat. This will also ultimately help you send snaps to them without breaking the streak.

![pin conversation in snapchat](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/pin-conversation-in-snapchat.jpg)

**Idea 3\. Stick to a Particular Time of the Day**

You will gain more by starting your Snapstreaks later on in the day, especially if you are only sending one snap per day. This way, the hourglass emoji will be visible for a considerable amount of time before it expires.

**Idea 4\. Check Your Filters**

If you're trying to keep up with multiple Snapstreaks at once, it's easy to forget who you're on a streak with. But there's a way to see them without going to your list of friends.

Whenever you're about to send a new snap, swipe through the filters. Here, you'll see a special Snapchat streak filter, which will show how many consecutive days of successful streak you have in big white numbers next to the fire emoji.

## Conclusion

In this article, we've compiled a list of fun and creative **Snapchat streak ideas** to help you stay connected with your friends.

## Part 4: How to Make Screen Record on Snapchat without Notice?

It looks pretty embarrassing if you capture a screenshot and the other person receives a notification. The screen recording on Snapchat makes you awkward. To get rid of this embarrassment, one should use tricky and workable methods. Luckily, the section covers some of those methods. Let us have a look at each of them!

### Switching off the Internet Connection

The first method revolves around disabling the internet connection of your device. For starters, reload and refresh your Snapchat feed. Disconnect the Wi-Fi or data network, and then screen records the snap. It helps you get the task done without getting noticed, as the app doesn’t know what is happening without internet connectivity.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Enabling the Airplane Mode

One workable method is to enable the Airplane Mode before you plan to screen record Snapchat. What happens is that the app doesn’t respond to the operation occurring as Airplane Mode is switched on. The process doesn’t send the notification to the targeted person; thus, it always works.

### Using a Third-Party Software

You can access the [third-party screen recorder](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and then perform screen recording on Snapchat. The market offers numerous apps for a similar reason. Their usage is simple as well.
