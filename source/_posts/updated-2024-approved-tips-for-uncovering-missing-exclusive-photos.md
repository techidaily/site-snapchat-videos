Wondershare Filmora is a versatile yet powerful video editing software with intuitive tools. It comes packed with pretty filters, animated elements, and graphic overlays perfect for producing eye-catching videos. Filmora's pleasing interface can get the job done for you even if you're a beginner level video editor. Not to mention, it also lets you combine multiple videos and images seamlessly to create unique visual stories.

Quite sure you've seen a video somewhere with a sticker in it and wondered how did they add it? Well, you can stop wondering because I will show you just "how" using the Wondershare Filmora video editor.

1.Launch Wondershare Filmora and start a "New Project." Next, go to the File menu, to Import Media, and choose Import Media Files to import your video and the sticker.

4.Once the sticker is adjusted, press the Export button to convert the video. You can export the video to your local drive, smartphone, or YouTube directly.

If you're running the latest Filmora version (at the time of writing, V10.5), you can add the face-tracking AR stickers to people in the video.

Below is a brief tutorial about how to add AR stickers in Filmora.

Go to the **Effects** tab, and then scroll down to the AR Stickers directly.
