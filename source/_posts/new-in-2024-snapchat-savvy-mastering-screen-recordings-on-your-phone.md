## Part 4: How To Change Where Photos Are Saved in Snapchat

Some people like to save the phone's storage by saving the snaps to memories. If you prefer saving the snaps in memories instead of the camera roll, you can save the phone's storage space. Conversely, some people like to export their snaps to the camera roll if multiple people use their Snapchat.

For privacy matters, people like to save the snaps to the camera roll only. If you want to change the location where the photos are saved, you can check the below instructions:

Step1 Head to your Snapchat and tap on the Profile icon displayed in the top left corner. From there, select the "Settings" icon to proceed.
