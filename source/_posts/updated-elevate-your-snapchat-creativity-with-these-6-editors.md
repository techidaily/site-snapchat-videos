## How to Send a Snap from Memories/Camera Roll as a Snap

Are you tired of sending your live selfies as snaps to your friends? In this section, you can learn **how to send snaps from the camera roll** without capturing a live snap. For this, we will explain some manual methods as well as some reliable apps in a detailed manner.

### Method 1: Using a Snapchat Filter

Snapchat allows you to apply its filters on any of your camera roll's pictures. By selecting a particular photo or video from your memories or snap, you can instantly add a filter to them. Afterward, you can send the filtered image to your friends as a regular snap. However, this solution has a significant drawback that you must know. The limitation is that the receiver of the snap would be able to see that the sent picture is from the camera roll.

Step1 Open your Snapchat and swipe up to open the 'Memories'. Go to your Camera Roll and select any particular picture from there.

### Method 1: Using a Snapchat Filter

Snapchat allows you to apply its filters on any of your camera roll's pictures. By selecting a particular photo or video from your memories or snap, you can instantly add a filter to them. Afterward, you can send the filtered image to your friends as a regular snap. However, this solution has a significant drawback that you must know. The limitation is that the receiver of the snap would be able to see that the sent picture is from the camera roll.

Step1 Open your Snapchat and swipe up to open the 'Memories'. Go to your Camera Roll and select any particular picture from there.

### Method 2: Using a Sticker

If you want to make your camera roll picture funny and entertaining, you can add stickers to it. Through Snapchat, you can make your customized sticker of any interesting face or object. Moreover, Snapchat also offers a huge variety of built-in stickers. If you don't want to create a customized sticker, you can easily add the built-in sticker with a single tap.

Step1 Once you have opened your Snapchat, go to Memories. From there, you can access and select any picture from the Camera Roll.
