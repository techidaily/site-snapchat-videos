How to create a video best fit Snapchat? With more than 240 million active daily users, Snapchat is one of the most popular social media networks globally. It is also an instant messaging app that allows its users to express themselves visually in a diverse variety of manners including photos, videos, stories, stickers, emoji, and more.

One of the best features of Snapchat that makes it so attractive among the young audience is its mobile-oriented user interface. Snapchat was the first social networking platform to introduce the concept of daily stories which was widely adopted by other instant messengers as well including Instagram and WhatsApp. Since it is a mobile-oriented platform, you need to create and edit your videos in a certain way to make sure they are the best fit for Snapchat.

## What Are the Ideal Features of a Snapchat Video?

Snapchat is highly optimized for vertical viewing which means that all the content needs to be served in portrait aspect ratio instead of landscape used by YouTube and other video platforms. You need to ensure that every aspect of your video is perfect before you can upload it for Snapchat on Mac. Here are some of the key features that you must not forget.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/snapchat.jpg)

* **Resolution** \- The ideal resolution of a Snapchat video is **1080 x 1920** pixels which is known as full HD. This resolution will ensure that your video loads in the right way and remains sharp and crisp for an excellent viewing experience.
* **Video Format** \- The recommended video format for Snapchat clips is **MP4 and MOV. Y**ou can use either of those formats on your Mac.
* **Aspect Ratio** \- This is one of the key aspects of any video that determines the orientation of viewing. For a perfect Snapchat video, it is recommended that you keep the aspect ratio to **9:16**.
* **Video Length Size** \- Remember that Snapchat isn't like YouTube and serves an audience that wants micro-entertainment. This is why the recommended time for your video is **3 to 10 seconds** with the video size **not exceeding 32 MB**. Otherwise, the Snapchat audience may not respond well to your videos.

That is why it is crucial that your Snapchat video has all the ideal features so your audience can enjoy the viewing experience as intended instead of attempting to manipulate their phones to be able to see the video clearly. It will create an unpleasant and frustrating experience and your viewers might not stay with you.
