## Part 4: How to Make Screen Record on Snapchat without Notice?

### Switching off the Internet Connection

The first method revolves around disabling the internet connection of your device. For starters, reload and refresh your Snapchat feed. Disconnect the Wi-Fi or data network, and then screen records the snap. It helps you get the task done without getting noticed, as the app doesn‚Äôt know what is happening without internet connectivity.

### Enabling the Airplane Mode

One workable method is to enable the Airplane Mode before you plan to screen record Snapchat. What happens is that the app doesn‚Äôt respond to the operation occurring as Airplane Mode is switched on. The process doesn‚Äôt send the notification to the targeted person; thus, it always works.
