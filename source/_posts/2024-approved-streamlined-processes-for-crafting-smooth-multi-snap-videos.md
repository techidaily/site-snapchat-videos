 There are 3 options to respond to a call.

1. If they click on â€˜Watchâ€™ option, they can see you, but you arenâ€™t allowed for so.
2. If they tap â€˜Joinâ€™ option, it means both of you can see and talk to each other. In case they select â€˜Ignoreâ€™ option, you will get a busy message.
3. If you tap the green camera icon the video becomes one way, where only you can see them, but they wonâ€™t see you.

 Note: By swiping the screen down, you can minimize the Snapchat video call.
