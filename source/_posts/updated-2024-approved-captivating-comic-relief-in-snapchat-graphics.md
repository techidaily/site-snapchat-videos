Technology, certainly, has come a long way. In this era of digitalization, one can easily interact with friends on social media. With the emergence of social media, it has now become convenient to maintain social connections and support networks that otherwise wouldn’t have been possible. Social networking platforms have made staying connected with friends, family, and other acquaintances easier than ever.

Snapchat is one such platform that has gained immense popularity over recent years. A multimedia messaging app, it allows you to share pictures and videos with your friends and dear ones. The app lets you take snaps and apply filters and lenses to best express yourself. You can use the **best Snapchat filters** and lenses to add personality and whimsy to snaps.

Whether you want to have some fun with your friends or want to impress someone, Snapchat has amazing effects for every occasion. Indeed, Instagram’s story highlights have become one of the biggest social media platforms. However, by the end of June 2021, Snapchat claimed to have increased its global daily active users to 293 million.

Snapchat’s lenses and filters have become so famous that Instagram has mimicked the feature. But, there’s a reason why snaps are regularly circulating outside Snapchat - the fantastic creative effects give it a leg up over Instagram. Snapchat’s extensive collection of funny lenses, cool filters, and stunning beauty filters makes it way better than Instagram’s.

Wondering how to find good face modifiers from a sea of clones out there? Relax! Our team at Wondershare has done the hard work and made a list of the best filters and lenses on Snapchat. But, first, let’s have a detailed insight into the best Snapchat filters and lenses.

* [Part 1: What Are the Differences Between Snapchat Filters and Lenses?](#part1)
* [Part 2: 20 Best Filters & Lenses On Snapchat to Use in 2021](#part2)
* [Part 3: FAQs About Snapchat Filters & Lenses](#part3)

## Part 1: What Are the Differences Between Snapchat Filters and Lenses?

Snapchat filters are static overlays and sit on the top of your photo or video. In contrast, Snapchat lenses are dynamic, augmented reality animations that alter your voice along with your appearance as you move on the screen. Unlike filters that are added after taking a photo, lenses are displayed while you’re taking the photo.

The best filters on Snapchat let you change a snap’s tint or change the direction or speed in which your video is played back. On the other hand, Snapchat lenses work by utilizing facial recognition software to track your features and apply an animation that follows your facial movements. While lenses can change the sound of your voice and the appearance of your face, filters can only add color tones, messages, customized images, and icons to your snaps.

The photo and video sharing app allow you to make your own filters and lenses. Creating a filter on Snapchat isn’t free as you will have to pay a certain amount based on the filter’s square foot. However, when it comes to making your own Snapchat lens, you won’t have to pay any fees as the entire process is free.

## Part 1: What Are the Differences Between Snapchat Filters and Lenses?

Snapchat filters are static overlays and sit on the top of your photo or video. In contrast, Snapchat lenses are dynamic, augmented reality animations that alter your voice along with your appearance as you move on the screen. Unlike filters that are added after taking a photo, lenses are displayed while you’re taking the photo.

The best filters on Snapchat let you change a snap’s tint or change the direction or speed in which your video is played back. On the other hand, Snapchat lenses work by utilizing facial recognition software to track your features and apply an animation that follows your facial movements. While lenses can change the sound of your voice and the appearance of your face, filters can only add color tones, messages, customized images, and icons to your snaps.

The photo and video sharing app allow you to make your own filters and lenses. Creating a filter on Snapchat isn’t free as you will have to pay a certain amount based on the filter’s square foot. However, when it comes to making your own Snapchat lens, you won’t have to pay any fees as the entire process is free.
