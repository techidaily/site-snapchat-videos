 Don’t leave the button even after the time is over. As you keep holding the button, the next snap starts recording automatically.

 When you think it’s complete, at the bottom of the screen you can see the snaps appearing.

 The ones you wish to keep must be saved and the rest can be dragged in order to delete.

 Finally, you may edit the snaps and add effects like you do with any usual snap at the same time.
