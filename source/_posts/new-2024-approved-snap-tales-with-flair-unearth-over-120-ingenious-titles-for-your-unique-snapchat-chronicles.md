Hence, it's an excellent app for taking interesting and vibrant snaps flawlessly.

If you are a regular user of Snapchat and want to learn **how to save snaps to the camera roll**, this article will help you. By applying the suggested methods, you can save your snaps to the smartphone.

## Part 1: Save Snaps to Camera Roll or Gallery Instead of Memories

If you want to share your snaps on other social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook, you should save your snaps on your phone's gallery. The saved snaps in your phone's gallery can be located and shared on other platforms without hassle. Read the following instructions on **how to save snaps to the camera roll** or gallery quickly:

Step1 Navigate to your Snapchat and tap on your Bitmoji icon displayed in the top left corner. Afterward, select the "Settings" icon displayed at the top right corner.

Step1 Open your Snapchat and tap on the "Snaps" icon given below. This will open all the captured snaps on your phone.

## Part 3: Save Multiple Snaps to Camera Roll at Once

Many people like to capture pictures of a particular event on their Snapchat. However, if your taken snaps are not saved in the camera roll, you may have difficulty sharing the images with others on other social media apps. You can save time by saving multiple snaps to the camera roll all at once. Through the following steps, you can learn **how to save snaps to the camera roll** all at once:

Step1 Open your Snapchat and swipe up from the bottom using your finger. This will open all the captured snaps on your screen.
