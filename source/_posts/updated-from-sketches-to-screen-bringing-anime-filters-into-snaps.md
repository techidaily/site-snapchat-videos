## Part 1: What is Anime Filter on Snapchat?

Out of the many AR lenses from Snapchat, the latest one is the anime lens. It's a filter that will morph a person's photo or video into an anime character and will customize the anime face based on the person's facial features. So, rather than simply applying a generic image on top of your face, Snapchat makes sure that the anime image looks similar to your actual image. And as a result, each person's anime face turns out to be different.

Since the hashtag #animefilter is trending, you can also apply the anime filter on your face and be a part of the trend. The reaction to this filter is lowkey amazing because the filter not only changes your face and makes it look like a part of a hit anime cartoon series or movie, but it sometimes also changes your hair color making you look like the King of the Pirates or Rapunzel. What this lens will do and how your image will turn out to be is highly fascinating.

What stands out is that after the **anime** **filter** **of** **Snapchat** was released, it has been used over 3 billion times. Snapchat has confirmed this statistic in its Third Quarter 2020 Financial report, and they even said that they already knew it would be a massive hit.

### Method 1: Get the Anime Face Filter on Snapchat via Link

**Step 1:**  First, click on the link [here](https://www.snapchat.com/unlock/?type=SNAPCODE&uuid=ff9460034fee44a08e9a4282560cce36&metadata=01). You will need this link to get the anime face filter.

**Step 2:**  Once you click on the click, a pop-up window will open. If you haven't downloaded the anime filter yet, then Snapchat will say, "New lens found." Right below it, you will see the message "unlock for 48 hours." Go ahead and click on that.

**Step 3:**  By clicking on the purple button, your **Snapchat anime** filter will be available for use for 48 hours.

Here's a pro tip, if you want to continue using this filter, once the 48 hours are over, simply repeat the steps, and you can use it for additional 48 hours. Simple!

If the pop-up says, “nothing to see here”, which means you have the filter already. In this case, you can go to Snapchat and click the filter accordingly.

### Method 2: Get the Anime Style Filter via Explore on Snapchat

If you don’t want to click any unknown links, you can explore the anime filter by searching on Snapchat.

**Step 1:**  Make sure your Snapchat is up-to-date. If not, update it to the latest version.

**Step 2:**  Open Snapchat on your mobile or tablet, whichever you are using. Now, turn the lens towards you or someone else as if you are clicking a picture.

**Step 3:**  Now, click on the smiley face filter button, and tap on the Explore button to continue.

**Step 4:**  You can now search for Anime Styles. There are several anime filters available, just make sure that the creator of the filter is Snapchat.

**Step 5:**  Once you have the anime filter, you can record a video of yourself, or take photos. You may also use both back and front cameras to turn anyone into an anime character.

**Pro tip:**  This filter works on already saved photos and videos as well. Try them on too. This filter will work only on your face, though. So, it won't turn your entire body into an anime character.

## Part 3: How Do I Get More Filters on Snapchat?

Since Snapchat keeps coming up with attractive filters, you may wonder how you can get more filters to keep using them. Well, there are a few tricks that you can try. We will explain these tricks in detail, so make sure to follow them correctly.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BGeneral%2B970x90%2B"><img src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/general-970x90.gif" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Trick 1: Turn on Snapchat Geofilters

Before you try using Snapchat geofilters, you will first have to permit Snapchat to access your location. Whether you are using iOS or Android, enable location, and you will start seeing geofilters and all the other filters that you have saved.

Don't expect a plethora of filters to suddenly turn up. For example, when you apply a geofilter, you will see that it adds an illustration and the place name to your Snap. So, the more you explore and go out, the more filters you will start seeing.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Trick 2: Check Online Resources on Lens Studio and Lenslist

You can also explore two filter libraries, which are Lens Studio and Lenslist. These are repositories of AR content. These two libraries have many attractive filters. All you need to do is scan the Snapcode available in the filters and unlock them. Both of them will have duplicate filters as well, though. But dig a bit deeper, and you will have enough codes of filters to keep using them every day. You will find these codes in your profile once you add them.

### Trick 3: Share Snapcodes for Snapchat

The last way to add Snapcode of filters is by scanning other people's codes. Once you go to your profile, you will see your Snapcodes, which other people can scan. Just like that, you can scan other people's code as well. Some codes will be available for 24 hours, while others for 48 hours. After that, you can scan the code again when you want to reuse them. To scan a code, just hold your camera over the code and allow the screen to register it.

## Bonus: How to Add Anime Effect to Video with Filmora

As we shared, Snapchat will only morph your face into an anime character. But if you are not satisfied with that and want to turn a whole video into anime or cartoon, then one of the best ways to go about it is by getting Wondershare Filmora. Filmora is an easy-to-use yet powerful enough video editing tool loaded with stunning effects, such as cartoons, sketches, color sketches, and more. The process is very easy to follow, and to use Filmora, you don't need to be a pro. Here are the steps that you can follow:

**Step 1:** Launch Wondershare Filmora to your Mac or Windows computer. If you haven’t downloaded it yet, click the Try It Free button below to start.

**Step 2:**  Now, import media files and load the video that you want to convert into a cartoon or anime to the media library, and then add that video to the timeline.

**Snapchat anime filter** is the new sensation that is making waves all across social media. The best part about anime filter is that it has the ability to transform your videos and images into anime instantly. This filter has already gone viral on other social media platforms, such as TikTok, Instagram, and Twitter.

Filters and effects are not new when it comes to social media services, and almost all of them have their own versions, which you can use. Snapchat is here with a new lens, which is becoming immensely popular. If you have been trying to use the **Snapchat anime** filter and don't know how to go about it, you have come to the right place because this article will talk about how to get this filter and how to use it. Keep reading!

## Part 1: What is Anime Filter on Snapchat?

Out of the many AR lenses from Snapchat, the latest one is the anime lens. It's a filter that will morph a person's photo or video into an anime character and will customize the anime face based on the person's facial features. So, rather than simply applying a generic image on top of your face, Snapchat makes sure that the anime image looks similar to your actual image. And as a result, each person's anime face turns out to be different.

Since the hashtag #animefilter is trending, you can also apply the anime filter on your face and be a part of the trend. The reaction to this filter is lowkey amazing because the filter not only changes your face and makes it look like a part of a hit anime cartoon series or movie, but it sometimes also changes your hair color making you look like the King of the Pirates or Rapunzel. What this lens will do and how your image will turn out to be is highly fascinating.

What stands out is that after the **anime** **filter** **of** **Snapchat** was released, it has been used over 3 billion times. Snapchat has confirmed this statistic in its Third Quarter 2020 Financial report, and they even said that they already knew it would be a massive hit.

## Part 2: How to Get the Anime Filter on Snapchat?

Now that you know how popular the **Snapchat anime filter** is. It's worth knowing how to get it. Although this filter is available on Snapchat, many users are facing issues finding it. This section will show you two easy ways to get this filter. You can use one or both methods and start using the filter to show the world how you will look like an anime character. Here are the two ways:

### Method 1: Get the Anime Face Filter on Snapchat via Link

**Step 2:**  Once you click on the click, a pop-up window will open. If you haven't downloaded the anime filter yet, then Snapchat will say, "New lens found." Right below it, you will see the message "unlock for 48 hours." Go ahead and click on that.

Here's a pro tip, if you want to continue using this filter, once the 48 hours are over, simply repeat the steps, and you can use it for additional 48 hours. Simple!

If the pop-up says, “nothing to see here”, which means you have the filter already. In this case, you can go to Snapchat and click the filter accordingly.

### Method 2: Get the Anime Style Filter via Explore on Snapchat

If you don’t want to click any unknown links, you can explore the anime filter by searching on Snapchat.

**Step 1:**  Make sure your Snapchat is up-to-date. If not, update it to the latest version.

**Step 2:**  Open Snapchat on your mobile or tablet, whichever you are using. Now, turn the lens towards you or someone else as if you are clicking a picture.

**Step 3:**  Now, click on the smiley face filter button, and tap on the Explore button to continue.

![Explore the snapchat anime filter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/explore-anime-style-filter-snapchat.jpg)

**Step 4:**  You can now search for Anime Styles. There are several anime filters available, just make sure that the creator of the filter is Snapchat.

**Step 5:**  Once you have the anime filter, you can record a video of yourself, or take photos. You may also use both back and front cameras to turn anyone into an anime character.

**Pro tip:**  This filter works on already saved photos and videos as well. Try them on too. This filter will work only on your face, though. So, it won't turn your entire body into an anime character.

## Part 3: How Do I Get More Filters on Snapchat?

Since Snapchat keeps coming up with attractive filters, you may wonder how you can get more filters to keep using them. Well, there are a few tricks that you can try. We will explain these tricks in detail, so make sure to follow them correctly.

### Trick 1: Turn on Snapchat Geofilters

Before you try using Snapchat geofilters, you will first have to permit Snapchat to access your location. Whether you are using iOS or Android, enable location, and you will start seeing geofilters and all the other filters that you have saved.

Don't expect a plethora of filters to suddenly turn up. For example, when you apply a geofilter, you will see that it adds an illustration and the place name to your Snap. So, the more you explore and go out, the more filters you will start seeing.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Trick 2: Check Online Resources on Lens Studio and Lenslist

You can also explore two filter libraries, which are Lens Studio and Lenslist. These are repositories of AR content. These two libraries have many attractive filters. All you need to do is scan the Snapcode available in the filters and unlock them. Both of them will have duplicate filters as well, though. But dig a bit deeper, and you will have enough codes of filters to keep using them every day. You will find these codes in your profile once you add them.

### Trick 3: Share Snapcodes for Snapchat

The last way to add Snapcode of filters is by scanning other people's codes. Once you go to your profile, you will see your Snapcodes, which other people can scan. Just like that, you can scan other people's code as well. Some codes will be available for 24 hours, while others for 48 hours. After that, you can scan the code again when you want to reuse them. To scan a code, just hold your camera over the code and allow the screen to register it.

## Part 3: Save Multiple Snaps to Camera Roll at Once

Many people like to capture pictures of a particular event on their Snapchat. However, if your taken snaps are not saved in the camera roll, you may have difficulty sharing the images with others on other social media apps. You can save time by saving multiple snaps to the camera roll all at once. Through the following steps, you can learn **how to save snaps to the camera roll** all at once:

Step1 Open your Snapchat and swipe up from the bottom using your finger. This will open all the captured snaps on your screen.

Step2 Now tap and hold any specific snap that will allow you to select multiple snaps. You can see the "Tick" icon on the snaps that you have selected. Once you choose all the snaps you want to save to the camera roll, tap on the "Export" button displayed below.

![select your snaps](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/save-snaps-to-camera-roll-6.jpg)

## Part 4: How To Change Where Photos Are Saved in Snapchat

Some people like to save the phone's storage by saving the snaps to memories. If you prefer saving the snaps in memories instead of the camera roll, you can save the phone's storage space. Conversely, some people like to export their snaps to the camera roll if multiple people use their Snapchat.

For privacy matters, people like to save the snaps to the camera roll only. If you want to change the location where the photos are saved, you can check the below instructions:

Step1 Head to your Snapchat and tap on the Profile icon displayed in the top left corner. From there, select the "Settings" icon to proceed.
