## Part 1: How to Save Snapchats without them knowing

 You want to save a friendâ€™s Snaps, but Snapchat immediately alerts them of the screen shot taken. Hence, it is not possible to save otherâ€™s pictures or videos in Snapchat in incognito mode. You donâ€™t need apps to save Snapchat to your phone. There is hardly a feasible way to do so without the sendersâ€™ knowledge. In such a situation, you can try out the following option â€“ saving Snaps in flight mode.

 Here are the steps

1. First of all, launch the Snapchat app on your mobile phone and leave it open. Go to your phoneâ€™s â€˜Settingsâ€™ (Android/iPhone) and toggle on the â€˜Airplane/Flightâ€™ mode. Airplane/Flight mode disables all the wireless connections, be it network signals or internet related services for your device (Wi-Fi as well as cellular).

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![snapchat save without knowing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snapchat-save-without-knowing.JPG)

2. Browse the Snapchat inbox and view the desired Snap that you wish to save, and quickly take a screenshot. Make sure to be quick enough and do it before the Snap expires.
3. Now, logout from your Snapchat account right after taking the screenshot. You need to follow the logout process according to your device specific settings. Being in â€˜Airplane/Flightâ€™ mode you canâ€™t logout, but click the logout option anyway (this is vital!).

![snapchat log out](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snapchat-log-out.JPG)

4. Here, you need to close the Snapchat app on your mobile phone by swiping out the Snapchat app (up/sideways depending on Android/iPhone) from your deviceâ€™s force quit screen.
5. Toggle off the â€˜Airplane/Flightâ€™ mode and wait until your phone connects to the Wi-Fi or mobile network. Now, launch the Snapchat app again and login with the same credentials. The Snaps you have taken screenshots of will still appear as unopened on the storyboard and your friend will have no clue about the Snap being screenshot.

## Part 3: How to save Snapchat videos on Android

 Step-by-step Tutorial

1. Download the Apk file, install, and launch the AZ Screen Recorder Snapchat App. Set up the account in your Android phone with required information.

3. Stop the recording by tapping the â€˜Recordâ€™ button again.

 The popular social networking app Snapchat comes with some ephemeral features. This self-deleting feature deters users from **saving Snapchat videos** of their friends. Snapchat photos, videos, and stories of contacts vanish from storyboard right after you view them.

 So, what will you do to save photos or videos from your friendsâ€™ Snapchat or Snap Stories long before they are gone? You can take a screenshot, save in flight mode, use your computer, or an app to capture the videos and images.

 Through this article, we are going to tell you, how to save Snapchats to your phone to make you watch them later.

## Part 1: How to Save Snapchats without them knowing

 You want to save a friendâ€™s Snaps, but Snapchat immediately alerts them of the screen shot taken. Hence, it is not possible to save otherâ€™s pictures or videos in Snapchat in incognito mode. You donâ€™t need apps to save Snapchat to your phone. There is hardly a feasible way to do so without the sendersâ€™ knowledge. In such a situation, you can try out the following option â€“ saving Snaps in flight mode.

 Here are the steps

1. First of all, launch the Snapchat app on your mobile phone and leave it open. Go to your phoneâ€™s â€˜Settingsâ€™ (Android/iPhone) and toggle on the â€˜Airplane/Flightâ€™ mode. Airplane/Flight mode disables all the wireless connections, be it network signals or internet related services for your device (Wi-Fi as well as cellular).

![snapchat save without knowing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snapchat-save-without-knowing.JPG)

2. Browse the Snapchat inbox and view the desired Snap that you wish to save, and quickly take a screenshot. Make sure to be quick enough and do it before the Snap expires.
3. Now, logout from your Snapchat account right after taking the screenshot. You need to follow the logout process according to your device specific settings. Being in â€˜Airplane/Flightâ€™ mode you canâ€™t logout, but click the logout option anyway (this is vital!).

![snapchat log out](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snapchat-log-out.JPG)

4. Here, you need to close the Snapchat app on your mobile phone by swiping out the Snapchat app (up/sideways depending on Android/iPhone) from your deviceâ€™s force quit screen.
5. Toggle off the â€˜Airplane/Flightâ€™ mode and wait until your phone connects to the Wi-Fi or mobile network. Now, launch the Snapchat app again and login with the same credentials. The Snaps you have taken screenshots of will still appear as unopened on the storyboard and your friend will have no clue about the Snap being screenshot.
