This includes a tremendous impact on your clip as of now reversed video. So, beyond any doubt, say something while recording your video.
2. Do the bizarre: If you're aiming to be turning back time, your superior does it in fashion! Utilize the switch movement channel on things that don't, as a rule, work that way. Like streaming water, flying feathered creatures, running mutts, you get the thought.
3. Moderate that video down: Most phones these days have a few frames of slow-motion shooting mode in their camera app. Shoot your video in moderate movement, and after that, utilize the reverse motion channel on it.
4. Shoot in great lighting: We know how terrible the Snapchat camera is. So, when shooting a video, shoot it in great characteristic light. Well, there you've got it! Have fun messing around with the reverse effect, and create a few intriguing science-defying snaps within the deal!
