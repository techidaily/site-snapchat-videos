Snapchat comes with a drawing tool that you can use to add a personal touch to your photos or create fun and unique designs in the following way:

Step1 On your selected picture, tap the **Pencil** icon to open the drawing tool. Drag your finger on the **Color meter** to select the color.

Step2 Tap the **Color wheel** to change the color palette and then choose the color you want. To draw emojis on your picture, tap the Emoji icon and select the one you want to use.

### How To Add A Theme

Adding a theme to your images on Snapchat is a great way to add some personality and style. Here's how you can do this:

Step1 Tap the **Paintbrush** icon from the Snapchat editing tools at the left of your picture.

Step2 Search for the theme using the **Search box** or scroll up and down to find the one you like.
