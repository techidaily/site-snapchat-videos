One of the best features of Snapchat that makes it so attractive among the young audience is its mobile-oriented user interface.

## What Are the Ideal Features of a Snapchat Video?

Snapchat is highly optimized for vertical viewing which means that all the content needs to be served in portrait aspect ratio instead of landscape used by YouTube and other video platforms. You need to ensure that every aspect of your video is perfect before you can upload it for Snapchat on Mac. Here are some of the key features that you must not forget.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/snapchat.jpg)

* **Resolution** \- The ideal resolution of a Snapchat video is **1080 x 1920** pixels which is known as full HD. This resolution will ensure that your video loads in the right way and remains sharp and crisp for an excellent viewing experience.
* **Video Format** \- The recommended video format for Snapchat clips is **MP4 and MOV. Y**ou can use either of those formats on your Mac.
* **Aspect Ratio** \- This is one of the key aspects of any video that determines the orientation of viewing. For a perfect Snapchat video, it is recommended that you keep the aspect ratio to **9:16**.
* **Video Length Size** \- Remember that Snapchat isn't like YouTube and serves an audience that wants micro-entertainment. This is why the recommended time for your video is **3 to 10 seconds** with the video size **not exceeding 32 MB**. Otherwise, the Snapchat audience may not respond well to your videos.

That is why it is crucial that your Snapchat video has all the ideal features so your audience can enjoy the viewing experience as intended instead of attempting to manipulate their phones to be able to see the video clearly. It will create an unpleasant and frustrating experience and your viewers might not stay with you.

## Part 5: What are the differences between Snapchat Cartoon Lens and [Anime Filters](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)?

Essentially, the difference between a filter and a lens is that the lens is an augmented reality animation, while the filter is a static image overlay.

To Distinguish the difference between Snapchat filters and lenses: Snapchat filters are static and located on top of images or videos. On the other hand, Snapchat lenses are augmented reality animations that can change your voice in addition to changing your appearance on the screen.

**Conclusion**

Snapchat is primarily known for its lens and filters. Many other apps even try to copy the filers but certainly couldn’t make it up. To develop the longest streak with your friends, you need to use Snapchat daily. Hence, Snapchat would never get you bored if you have to use it and send a snap with the cartoon face lens daily to friends. The regularly updating lens and the streak will keep you engaged in it every day. The app does not demand much high configuration and high storage. Hence, the app can fit into any individual and is easy to operate.
