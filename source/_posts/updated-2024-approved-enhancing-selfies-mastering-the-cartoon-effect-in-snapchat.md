Snapchat is primarily known for its lens and filters. Many other apps even try to copy the filers but certainly couldn’t make it up. To develop the longest streak with your friends, you need to use Snapchat daily. Hence, Snapchat would never get you bored if you have to use it and send a snap with the cartoon face lens daily to friends. The regularly updating lens and the streak will keep you engaged in it every day. The app does not demand much high configuration and high storage. Hence, the app can fit into any individual and is easy to operate.

You could also ask a common friend if they have even received stories and updates from that person. If the person’s stories are reaching others but not you, that means that they have hidden their stories from you.

**Can You Hide Someone on Snapchat Without Them Knowing?**

If you wish to hide someone but in a way that they do not find out, try the new muting function. This allows you to mute certain friends without them realizing the same. The feature is called ‘Do Not Disturb’ and it allows you to mute conversations that are one on one or come from groups. The feature is a new addition and is a useful one. You need not hide or block any contact in this case but simply silence notifications of their updates.

To use this feature, all you need to do is tap on the group or the person you wish to silence. The popup menu would include ‘Settings’ and here you can select the option ‘Do Not Disturb’. You will not receive notifications from such conversations. However, you will still be able to access, check messages from such contacts as well as share your stories as well.

This feature is a useful addition and you need not hide or block a contact to silence conversations from them. Hence, those people will also not get notified unlike when you block a contact. It allows you to see updates from them at your ease and convenience.

### Conclusion

Snapchat is an attractive platform to get your daily moments the attention they deserve. You can create stories, private or with anyone else, and share them with selective people of your choice. The Snapchat private story option is great to keep your moments between your close friends or loved ones. Other features such as ‘Do Not Disturb’ allow you to silence notifications from friends or groups that you wish to check as per your convenience.
