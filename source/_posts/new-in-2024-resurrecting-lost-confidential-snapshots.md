#### Step 3: Choose filters

The best part about Snapchat filters is, you not only can use them while clicking a picture, but can also add filters post clicking picture. There are 2 ways to select filters after clicking your picture.

* As soon as you are done clicking a snap, slide the screen to left and you can find the latest filters. Choose whatever filters from the list catches your fancy.
* If you are not happy with these filters from option ‘a’, then don’t get sad. We have a lot more for you, like a set of secret Snapchat filters. After clicking the picture you will see a ‘smiley icon’ on the right side of the screen. Tap the ‘smiley icon’ and then scroll up or down to pick the most enchanting filter for you.

Once you are done finalizing the effects (filters), you can save or share the snap.
