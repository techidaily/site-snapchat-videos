It is also an instant messaging app that allows its users to express themselves visually in a diverse variety of manners including photos, videos, stories, stickers, emoji, and more.

One of the best features of Snapchat that makes it so attractive among the young audience is its mobile-oriented user interface.

## What Are the Ideal Features of a Snapchat Video?

Snapchat is highly optimized for vertical viewing which means that all the content needs to be served in portrait aspect ratio instead of landscape used by YouTube and other video platforms. You need to ensure that every aspect of your video is perfect before you can upload it for Snapchat on Mac. Here are some of the key features that you must not forget.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/snapchat.jpg)

* **Resolution** \- The ideal resolution of a Snapchat video is **1080 x 1920** pixels which is known as full HD. This resolution will ensure that your video loads in the right way and remains sharp and crisp for an excellent viewing experience.
* **Video Format** \- The recommended video format for Snapchat clips is **MP4 and MOV. Y**ou can use either of those formats on your Mac.
* **Aspect Ratio** \- This is one of the key aspects of any video that determines the orientation of viewing. For a perfect Snapchat video, it is recommended that you keep the aspect ratio to **9:16**.
* **Video Length Size** \- Remember that Snapchat isn't like YouTube and serves an audience that wants micro-entertainment. This is why the recommended time for your video is **3 to 10 seconds** with the video size **not exceeding 32 MB**. Otherwise, the Snapchat audience may not respond well to your videos.

That is why it is crucial that your Snapchat video has all the ideal features so your audience can enjoy the viewing experience as intended instead of attempting to manipulate their phones to be able to see the video clearly. It will create an unpleasant and frustrating experience and your viewers might not stay with you.

2. Cropping Your Video for Snapchat

Here you can use the 'Crop and Zoom' button from the Timeline by right-clicking on it, so you can only focus on the aspect of the video that you want to show. This will resize the video as well.

3. Cutting the Video

Another option you have is to delete the unnecessary parts of the video by selecting them through the indicator present on the timeline. Once you have selected the parts you don't need, right-click on them and select 'Delete'.

4. Exporting Your Snapchat Video

Once you have resized your video by cropping and cutting the media file, you can now export it in the right resolution, bit rate, and format to ensure you get the minimum file size.

Snapchat has taken over the selfie game since it has first been launched. Its lenses and filters are quite popular and dominating in the selfie game all around us. These filters can be a lot of fun, from changing your hairstyle to changing your background.

Snapchat offers its users almost every type of filter you can imagine. Nearly half a million filters are created every single month, which are perfectly working. From kids to grown-ups, everyone uses these filters for fun, to make themselves look weird, cool, or just a bit nicer. Snapchat has plenty of lenses and cool filters, making people fall in love with the app. People can also create their filters and help them engage with their brands and businesses. Let's explore some of the best Snapchat filters of 2021!

## Part 1: Most Popular Snapchat Filters for Selfies in 2021

**Let's have a look at the most popular Snapchat filters for selfies as we all know there's a big range to choose from!**

#### 1\.  Fire Sunglasses

Whenever the users are feeling energetic and motivated, they use the "fire sunglasses" filter. They want to show everyone that they're on fire, and there couldn't be a better filter than this. It provides the users with a pair of glasses with fire on the glass, which adds to the energy.

The fire on the contacts gives you a fiery and relaxed look that catches people's attention. People can use it after their workouts or for motivational posts. This filter puts up an uplifting mood and gives you good vibes, but it might not be best suited for everyone.

#### 2\.  Neon Horns

The Classic filter, the devil's horn but in neon! Incredibly catchy to the eye and gives you a devilish look. This filter is a classic and is here to stay for a long time; there's no doubt in that.

For the first time, Horn Filters have taken one step further and given it a neon effect, making it even more appealing. The user can change the horn color; various options have been offered, such as black and white. Some more color options include lime green, magenta, orange, and light blue. It is an evergreen filter but has limited use. Want to know the best part? It sits perfectly according to your filter and does not glitch at all.

Cartoon 3D Style, one of the most popular filters on Snapchat and has every right to be! It gives you that unique specific animated look making you look like you just stepped out of a Disney movie. This filter adjusts itself according to our face cut and turns into Disney cartoons such as Kristoff.

People love to fool around with funny filters, and this one here has to be the best of them all. It gets better: from children to adults, everyone has undoubtedly used this filter. This filter has a soft shading giving it that artistic look like it had been hand-drawn; it's pretty fun when you make different faces with the filter on your face.

#### 4\.  Scary Mask

When people get bored from typical filters and don't get much response, they use funny or scary filters, which are way more fun. But here's the kicker: this filter covers half your face with a golden skull mask and turns your eyes into a golden flame color too. If we look at this from a different perspective, this can also spread awareness to wear masks during these challenging times. This filter has received so much response from the Snapchat users and finds a place in the "best filters on Snapchat" list!
