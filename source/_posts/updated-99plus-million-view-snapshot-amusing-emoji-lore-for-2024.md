#### 7.What the behavior dude

Get your Snapchat fam crack up your snap with this super funny Snapchat sticker. For me, it represents a ludicrous situation; most of us end up in daily. Like when you ask for a new shampoo bottle while showering, only to get back the same bottle filled with water.

#### 10\. I'm not crying; you're crying

One of the best Snapchat stickers, I believe. It comes from those adorable situations when you're overwhelmed and just can't control your tears (certainly the tears of joy). Imagine your friend sent you a "100 reasons why I love you" text, and it got you awestruck. You won't find a sticker better than this to shower your friend with.
