## Part 1\. Snapchat Overview

Firstly, let's have an overview of Snapchat before we see how to draw your blueprint in Part 3 and Part 4.

Snapchat - founded by Evan Spiegel, Bobby Murphy, and Reggie Brown - is a unique messaging app because it allows users to send disappearing messages and photos. This feature has made the app popular with young people aged 13-34 who want to communicate without leaving a permanent record.

As of May 2022, Snapchat has [347 million daily active users.](https://www.statista.com/statistics/545967/snapchat-app-dau/#:~:text=How%20many%20daily%20active%20users,increase%20of%20over%2018%20percent.) That's impressive growth from its humble beginnings back in 2011\. With [monthly active users of 557](https://www.statista.com/statistics/272014/global-social-networks-ranked-by-number-of-users/), Snapchat is ranked as the 12th most popular social media platform.

Not only that, the number of [Snapchat daily video views is 18 billion,](https://www.omnicoreagency.com/snapchat-statistics/) making it the best platform to showcase your services/products and generate more income. However, all this is only possible with the right **Snapchat marketing strategy.**

## Part 2\. Why Should Business Market On Snapchat

So you are probably thinking why your business should be on Snapchat - because it's popular with teenagers and young adults. In fact, the platform has over 347 million daily active users, with **75%** being under the age of 34.

Therefore, if you're targeting a younger demographic, then Snapchat should definitely be part of your social media marketing strategy.

Another big reason is that Snapchat is incredibly engaging. The average Snapchat user opens the app at least 20 times a day and spends 25 - 30 minutes on the app each day, so that's a lot of potential exposure for your business.

Not only that, but since Snapchat is still a new field and opened up [ads to users in October 2014,](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/20/snapchat-messaging-app-ad-creepy-ouija) many big companies have not entered the market. This has created a huge opportunity for small businesses to market their products and generate leads to increase their sales.

With Snapchat, you can get discovered by users in their Discovery feeds or via Stories. Also, they can interact with your brand using the Geofilters, stickers, and lenses you've produced during your ad campaign.

For instance, Taco Bell created a filter for Cinco de Mayo. The filter received 224 Million views, which is insane. Nevertheless, this campaign kept users engaged and helped increase Taco Bell's sales.

You can create a Snapchat Story by taking a series of snaps and adding text, filters, and other effects to make the content more engaging and share it with your followers or make it public afterward.

* **Be creative**: Use Snapchat's unique features, such as filters and augmented reality, to create a story that is truly one of a kind.

### How To Advertise With Snapchat

Snapchat Ads are a form of advertisement that allows businesses to reach out to Snapchat users with creative and interactive content. These ads can take the form of filters, lenses, or Geofilters and can be targeted to specific users based on their interests and location.

Snapchat ads are a great way to reach a new audience and promote your business in a fun and engaging way. To learn how to create stunning and effective Snapchat ads, please read[Snapchat Ad 101](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

### Track and Measure your Marketing Results

You've created a Snapchat marketing strategy and are ready to start reaching your target audience. But how will you monitor if your marketing efforts are successful? The key is to track and measure your results so that you can make adjustments as needed.

While Snapchat doesn't offer robust analytics data, you can track the following metrics to monitor the results:

* By checking the number of views on your stories and ads to see how many people are viewing them.
* Check the length of the Story that received more viewers and try to make future ads and stories of the same length.
* Monitor the number of views on your First Snap and Last Snap and check whether the views are increasing or not.
* Analyze Engagement (the number of screenshots or direct messages) on your ads and stories. This will clearly tell you about your performance.

#### Step 3: Wait for answering

 Their phone will start ringing if they have enabled Snapchat notifications. Enabling notification will also let them know that you’re calling even if they are not using the app that time. Or else, they can only get the call, while using Snapchat.

 There are 3 options to respond to a call.

1. If they click on ‘Watch’ option, they can see you, but you aren’t allowed for so.
2. If they tap ‘Join’ option, it means both of you can see and talk to each other. In case they select ‘Ignore’ option, you will get a busy message.
3. If you tap the green camera icon the video becomes one way, where only you can see them, but they won’t see you.

 Note: By swiping the screen down, you can minimize the Snapchat video call.
