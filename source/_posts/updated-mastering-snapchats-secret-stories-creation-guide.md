## Troubleshooting Tips: When Someone Hide Their Snapchat Stories from You

**How to Know if Someone Hid Their Snapchat Story from You?**

There is a way to find out whether someone is hiding their Snapchat stories from you. You can use someone else’s account to check if their stories are showing on their feed. You could also send a private snap to that person. If he or she answers the same quickly and yet, you do not get to see their stories that would mean that you are hidden contact in their list.

You could also ask a common friend if they have even received stories and updates from that person. If the person’s stories are reaching others but not you, that means that they have hidden their stories from you.

**Can You Hide Someone on Snapchat Without Them Knowing?**

If you wish to hide someone but in a way that they do not find out, try the new muting function. This allows you to mute certain friends without them realizing the same. The feature is called ‘Do Not Disturb’ and it allows you to mute conversations that are one on one or come from groups. The feature is a new addition and is a useful one. You need not hide or block any contact in this case but simply silence notifications of their updates.

To use this feature, all you need to do is tap on the group or the person you wish to silence. The popup menu would include ‘Settings’ and here you can select the option ‘Do Not Disturb’. You will not receive notifications from such conversations. However, you will still be able to access, check messages from such contacts as well as share your stories as well.

This feature is a useful addition and you need not hide or block a contact to silence conversations from them. Hence, those people will also not get notified unlike when you block a contact. It allows you to see updates from them at your ease and convenience.

### Conclusion

Snapchat is an attractive platform to get your daily moments the attention they deserve. You can create stories, private or with anyone else, and share them with selective people of your choice. The Snapchat private story option is great to keep your moments between your close friends or loved ones. Other features such as ‘Do Not Disturb’ allow you to silence notifications from friends or groups that you wish to check as per your convenience.

## What Is a Private Story on Snapchat?

Stories are a term popular in Snapchat, to showcase images and videos for the last 24 hours. Stories can comprise photos as well as videos. You can post stories to your feed which you can view as well as your friends. These show your friends your different activities the day before. These exist for the next 24 hours within which you can replay them many times.

There is a difference between ‘My Stories’ and ‘Private Stories’. When you record and post a video or a photo on your Snapchat account publicly, it is seen by all your contacts. On the other hand, if you wish to post a private story, you need to create a custom story. After you create a custom story, you can then post the same as a private one. Here you select the ones who would view the story. You choose the contacts who would view the post before publishing it. Another aspect is that no one else can add content to the private stories you post on Snapchat.

## Troubleshooting Tips: When Someone Hide Their Snapchat Stories from You

**How to Know if Someone Hid Their Snapchat Story from You?**

There is a way to find out whether someone is hiding their Snapchat stories from you. You can use someone else’s account to check if their stories are showing on their feed. You could also send a private snap to that person. If he or she answers the same quickly and yet, you do not get to see their stories that would mean that you are hidden contact in their list.

You could also ask a common friend if they have even received stories and updates from that person. If the person’s stories are reaching others but not you, that means that they have hidden their stories from you.

**Can You Hide Someone on Snapchat Without Them Knowing?**

If you wish to hide someone but in a way that they do not find out, try the new muting function. This allows you to mute certain friends without them realizing the same. The feature is called ‘Do Not Disturb’ and it allows you to mute conversations that are one on one or come from groups. The feature is a new addition and is a useful one. You need not hide or block any contact in this case but simply silence notifications of their updates.

To use this feature, all you need to do is tap on the group or the person you wish to silence. The popup menu would include ‘Settings’ and here you can select the option ‘Do Not Disturb’. You will not receive notifications from such conversations. However, you will still be able to access, check messages from such contacts as well as share your stories as well.

This feature is a useful addition and you need not hide or block a contact to silence conversations from them. Hence, those people will also not get notified unlike when you block a contact. It allows you to see updates from them at your ease and convenience.

### Conclusion

Snapchat is an attractive platform to get your daily moments the attention they deserve. You can create stories, private or with anyone else, and share them with selective people of your choice. The Snapchat private story option is great to keep your moments between your close friends or loved ones. Other features such as ‘Do Not Disturb’ allow you to silence notifications from friends or groups that you wish to check as per your convenience.

## Part 1\. Snapchat Overview

Firstly, let's have an overview of Snapchat before we see how to draw your blueprint in Part 3 and Part 4.

Snapchat - founded by Evan Spiegel, Bobby Murphy, and Reggie Brown - is a unique messaging app because it allows users to send disappearing messages and photos. This feature has made the app popular with young people aged 13-34 who want to communicate without leaving a permanent record.

As of May 2022, Snapchat has [347 million daily active users.](https://www.statista.com/statistics/545967/snapchat-app-dau/#:~:text=How%20many%20daily%20active%20users,increase%20of%20over%2018%20percent.) That's impressive growth from its humble beginnings back in 2011\. With [monthly active users of 557](https://www.statista.com/statistics/272014/global-social-networks-ranked-by-number-of-users/), Snapchat is ranked as the 12th most popular social media platform.

Not only that, the number of [Snapchat daily video views is 18 billion,](https://www.omnicoreagency.com/snapchat-statistics/) making it the best platform to showcase your services/products and generate more income. However, all this is only possible with the right **Snapchat marketing strategy.**

This bundle includes Studio 200 for vMix from Virtualsetworks, HTTP Matrix 1.0 automation scheduler, and 4 introductory training videos from the Udemy vMix Basic to Amazing course. </a>

## Part 2\. Why Should Business Market On Snapchat

So you are probably thinking why your business should be on Snapchat - because it's popular with teenagers and young adults. In fact, the platform has over 347 million daily active users, with **75%** being under the age of 34.

Therefore, if you're targeting a younger demographic, then Snapchat should definitely be part of your social media marketing strategy.

Another big reason is that Snapchat is incredibly engaging. The average Snapchat user opens the app at least 20 times a day and spends 25 - 30 minutes on the app each day, so that's a lot of potential exposure for your business.

Not only that, but since Snapchat is still a new field and opened up [ads to users in October 2014,](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/20/snapchat-messaging-app-ad-creepy-ouija) many big companies have not entered the market. This has created a huge opportunity for small businesses to market their products and generate leads to increase their sales.

With Snapchat, you can get discovered by users in their Discovery feeds or via Stories. Also, they can interact with your brand using the Geofilters, stickers, and lenses you've produced during your ad campaign.

For instance, Taco Bell created a filter for Cinco de Mayo. The filter received 224 Million views, which is insane. Nevertheless, this campaign kept users engaged and helped increase Taco Bell's sales.

### Track and Measure your Marketing Results

You've created a Snapchat marketing strategy and are ready to start reaching your target audience. But how will you monitor if your marketing efforts are successful? The key is to track and measure your results so that you can make adjustments as needed.

While Snapchat doesn't offer robust analytics data, you can track the following metrics to monitor the results:

* By checking the number of views on your stories and ads to see how many people are viewing them.
* Check the length of the Story that received more viewers and try to make future ads and stories of the same length.
* Monitor the number of views on your First Snap and Last Snap and check whether the views are increasing or not.
* Analyze Engagement (the number of screenshots or direct messages) on your ads and stories. This will clearly tell you about your performance.
* Check the completion Rate (percentage of users who watched your stories and compare it with the increase in sales to see whether you are performing well or not.

Snapcode is a badge similar to QR codes that users can scan via their phone to find you quickly. You can use these codes to link your website, add a logo, or display them in your ads to create brand recognition.

Step1 Launch the **Snapchat** app (your business Snapchat account) and on the top-left side of your screen, tap the **Ghost/Profile** icon.

Step2 Now, tap the **Settings** icons, find the **"Snapcodes"** option and tap it. Select the **"Create Snapcodes"** option, add your URL, and tap **"Create."**

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Nail Snapchat Stories

Snapchat Stories are a collection of snaps strung together to create a narrative. They can be up to 24 hours long, and are viewable an unlimited number of times within that time frame.

You can create a Snapchat Story by taking a series of snaps and adding text, filters, and other effects to make the content more engaging and share it with your followers or make it public afterward.

![snapchat stories](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/snapchat-stories.jpg)

Here are a few tips and approaches to help you create a Snapchat story that will capture your audience's attention:

* **Keep it short and sweet:** Snapchat stories are only 10 seconds long, so make sure your story is concise and to the point.
* **Use high-quality visuals:** Since Snapchat is all about visuals, use high-quality images and videos in your story.
* **Be creative**: Use Snapchat's unique features, such as filters and augmented reality, to create a story that is truly one of a kind.

### How To Advertise With Snapchat

Snapchat Ads are a form of advertisement that allows businesses to reach out to Snapchat users with creative and interactive content. These ads can take the form of filters, lenses, or Geofilters and can be targeted to specific users based on their interests and location.

Snapchat ads are a great way to reach a new audience and promote your business in a fun and engaging way. To learn how to create stunning and effective Snapchat ads, please read[Snapchat Ad 101](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

### Sponsored Geofilters

Geofilters are location-specific AR filters that you can create on-demand for your business to attract more customers. These filters can cost you **$5 to $20** depending upon the area/ square feet and duration, but they will surely help you attract more customers, resulting in more revenue.

### Sponsored Lenses

Sponsored lenses are AR filters businesses produce to interact with their users on Snapchat. Users can use these lenses to make inspiring snaps, send them to friends or have fun playing games using the gamified lenses.

For instance, Sephora created a gamified AR experience for their advertisement campaign on Snapchat. They provide coupons and promo codes to the users who completed the game. This helped them boost their products' sales and ultimately generate more sales.

### Track and Measure your Marketing Results

You've created a Snapchat marketing strategy and are ready to start reaching your target audience. But how will you monitor if your marketing efforts are successful? The key is to track and measure your results so that you can make adjustments as needed.

While Snapchat doesn't offer robust analytics data, you can track the following metrics to monitor the results:

* By checking the number of views on your stories and ads to see how many people are viewing them.
* Check the length of the Story that received more viewers and try to make future ads and stories of the same length.
* Monitor the number of views on your First Snap and Last Snap and check whether the views are increasing or not.
* Analyze Engagement (the number of screenshots or direct messages) on your ads and stories. This will clearly tell you about your performance.
* Check the completion Rate (percentage of users who watched your stories and compare it with the increase in sales to see whether you are performing well or not.

Apart from what has been mentioned above, we have also prepared you with a video about how to develop business on Snapchat. You can watch to facilitate your plan on that platform.
