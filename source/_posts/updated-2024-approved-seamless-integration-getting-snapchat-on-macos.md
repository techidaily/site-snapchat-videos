## Part 3: FAQs about Using Snapchat on Mac

**1\. Is it possible to get Snapchat on a Mac?**

Yes. Officially, it is not possible to use Snapchat on Mac without using any Android Emulator. Thus, we have mentioned how to use Snapchat on Mac with BlueStacks and Nox Player.

**2\. How do I log into Snapchat on my Mac?**

You can log into Snapchat on Mac only after you’ve installed it over your Mac computer. And, we all know that the Snapchat app is not officially available for Mac. So, you need to primarily download the Android Emulator and then install Snapchat from the Google Play Store via the Emulator itself.

 **3\. How can I use Snapchat on my Mac without BlueStacks?**

There isn’t the best and free Android Emulator than the Nox Player if you want to replace BlueStacks.

**4\. Is BlueStacks Mac safe?**

Yes, the BlueStacks is entirely safe for any operating system, regardless of Mac. It is legal as well.

**5\. Is Nox better than BlueStacks?**

Both are Android Emulators and have their corresponding benefits. However, the Nox is said to be quick and smooth running software than BlueStacks. But then, there is no need to download software like Virtual Box on BlueStacks. So, each software comes with its merits and demerits.
