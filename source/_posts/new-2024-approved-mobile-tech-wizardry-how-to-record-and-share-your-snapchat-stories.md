**Snapchat** is one of the most popular social media platforms of the present time and certainly needs no introduction. Though, to rival other apps like Instagram and TikTok, Snapchat has recently added a “Sound” feature. With this newly-added option, users can add music to a Snapchat video pretty easily and make their snaps more interesting. In this post, I’m going to let you know how to add music to a Snapchat video without any hassle. Let’s get it started and level-up your Snapchat game!

## Part 1: What's the Sound Feature in Snapchat?

Before we learn how to add music to your Snapchat video, let’s quickly get to know about the “Sounds” feature of the app. If you have been using Instagram or TikTok, then you might be familiar with their music feature.

Similarly, in 2020, Snapchat has also included a Sound feature that lets us add music to our snaps (photos or videos). For this, you can integrate Snapchat with a streaming service like Spotify, Pandora, Apple Music, or Soundcloud. While it doesn’t include all sorts of tracks, you can find most of the popular songs so that you can easily add music to a Snapchat video and make it interesting.

Once the other person would view your snap, they can hear the music playing in the background. If they want to listen to it or know more about the song, then they can just tap on its sticker on your snap.

## Part 2: How to Add Music to a Snapchat Video on iPhone or Android?

One of the best things about Snapchat is that the overall interface of the app is pretty similar for both iOS and Android versions. Therefore, to learn how to add music on a Snapchat video, you need to follow the same process. As of now, you can find almost all the popular songs on Snapchat and can even record your own sounds.

To learn how to add music to your Snapchat video on your Android or iOS device, you can just follow this simple drill.

**Step 1: Visit the Snapchat Sound section on the app**

At first, just launch the Snapchat application on your device and tap on the camera icon from the home to start recording.

Using the rear or front camera of your device, you can now record any video on Snapchat. Once the video is recorded, you can tap on the music icon from the sidebar to add a song to a Snapchat video.

**Step 2: Search for any music to include in your Snaps**

As you would tap on the **Music** icon, you can view a list of various songs supported by Snapchat. If you want to look for anything specific, then just tap on the search icon and enter keywords to find a song of your choice.

Afterward, Snapchat will list the searched results, and you can tap on the play icon to first listen to the song. Just tap on the icon of the song and click on the “Next” button from the bottom to include it in the snap.

**Step 3: Trim and add the song to your Snapchat video**

Now, Snapchat will automatically display the snippet of the music at the bottom. You can use the left or the right slider option to trim the section of the music you want to add. Here, you also can tap on the play icon to listen to the track first.

**Step 4: Add music to your Snapchat video after recording**

That’s it! Once you have trimmed the music snippet, you can post it. You can tap on the shutter or the download icon first to save the video on your phone.

Now, you can preview the music via its sticker. You can just tap on the music sticker to change its appearance or drag it on the screen to place it anywhere you like. To change its size, you can just pinch-in or pinch-out the sticker.

In the end, just tap on the send icon to post your snap. You can add it to your story or sent it to any Snapchat contact. When they would open it, they can listen to the added song and even tap on the sticker to load it.

In this way, anyone can learn how to put music on a Snapchat video without any hassle.

## Part 3: FAQs on Adding Music to a Snapchat Video

Now when you know how to add music to your Snapchat video, let’s clear some common doubts related to it.

* **How to add your own music to a Snapchat video?**

Apart from the available songs on Snapchat, the app also lets us add the sound of our choice. For this, just click on the music icon and tap the “Create Sound” button instead. This will let you record anything or create your own music on Snapchat.

* **Why are some songs not available on Snapchat?**

The Sound feature of Snapchat only provides licensed music by collaborating with some of the biggest record labels. Therefore, while you can find most of the popular songs, chances are that some of them might be missing from the collection.

* **Why can’t I add music to my Snapchat videos?**

Well, there could be two possible reasons for this – you might be using an old version of Snapchat or the feature might not be available in your region yet. To fix this, you can just go to the Snapchat page on the App/Play Store and tap on the “Update” button. Furthermore, if the Sound feature has not been rolled out to your region, then you can just wait for a while.

As you can see, it is pretty easy to learn how to add music to a Snapchat video like a pro. With the newly-added Sounds feature, it is pretty easy to add a song to your Snapchat videos and make them more interesting. Go ahead and try this feature to make your snaps creative and share this guide with others to teach them how do you add music to a Snapchat video as well.
