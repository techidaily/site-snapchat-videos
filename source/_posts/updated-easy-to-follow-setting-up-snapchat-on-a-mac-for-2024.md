The process to auto-save the stories to Memories is quite simple. For this, open the "Settings" of Snapchat and head to the "Memories" option. Under the heading called "Save Destination," tap on "Auto-Save My Story Snaps." Once done, enable the option "Auto-Save to Memories." Thus, your Snapchat stories will be automatically saved to your Memories.
