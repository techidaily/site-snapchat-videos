### Idea 1\. Conduct Interviews Via Snaps

If you are running your Snapchat like a YouTube channel, conducting interviews on Snapchat is a perfect way to get quick, candid responses from your interviewees. To make it more fun, captivating, and engaging, you can also use captivating Snaps to add a personal touch.

All you need is: set lighting and sound, a 10-second snap with a question on it, and the interviewee. Start by introducing the person in the frame, put the snap on the screen, and let the interviewee answer your question.

To make things interesting, add [filters](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), stickers, or [lenses](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to reflect the scenarios or your personality. In the outro, provide a snap to thank the interviewee and share their Snapcode to let people follow them, a call to action, a positive phrase like thanks for watching, or your other social media handles.

### Idea 2\. Host A YouTube And Snapchat Q&A

Another great idea is to host a YouTube and Snapchat Q&A. You can film with a famous snap chatter or YouTuber and ask them a few questions. You can also ask your followers/audience to send their questions via text message or response to your stories. This will help you get your viewers involved with your content and increase engagement.

To make sure your snap Q&A goes off without a hitch, be sure to:

* Set up your Snapchat settings of **"Who Can Contact Me"** to **"Everyone"** for a while to allow for questions.
* During the session, try to acknowledge who asked the question.
* After the session, change the "**Who Can Contact Me"** setting back to **only friends** to avoid spam overload.

### Idea 1\. Create Title Cards For Longer Snapchat Stories

If you're creating a Snapchat story that is longer than the standard 10 seconds, you can use title cards to help keep your viewers engaged.

Title cards are simply images with the text you can insert into your story to help identify what's coming next. For example, if you're sharing a story about your company's history, you could use a title card at the beginning of each section to identify the different parts of the story.

For this, you can take a snap of a wall or perhaps block your camera to get a black screen and then paste your text on the picture. You can also play with the font size, style, or color to create engaging title cards.

Since you cannot add clickable links to your snaps, using a shortened URL is an excellent approach to help people follow up on your links.

To get started, you need to find a URL shortener service such as [bitly.com](https://bitly.com/) and then begin sharing your shortened URLs with your Snapchat followers. You can add them to your snaps or post them in your story.

### Idea 3\. Sneak Peeks Of New Products

Giving your followers/customers a sneak peek of new products before they hit the shelves can excite them about your brand. This not only builds anticipation and excitement but also gives your fans a chance to be the first to know how and when to get their hands on your new products.

You can provide sneak peeks of new products on Snapchat in a number of ways. For instance, you can give short previews or teasers of products in your upcoming collection or first look at new products. You can even use Snapchat to give your fans a behind-the-scenes look at how your products are made.

Whatever approach you take, ensure that you're providing value to your audience. They should feel like they're getting something special by having a sneak peek of your new products.

### Idea 4\. Attach Your Username, Username URL, Or Snapchat Code

To get more audiences and followers on Snapchat, you can also try attaching your username, username URL, or Snapcode to your stories. These three approaches can help your customers find your account or add you as a friend on Snapchat.

To share your Snapchat username URL, open **Snapchat** and click your **Profile** icon. Tap on your **yellow Snapcode** to access more options. Tap **"Share My Profile Link"** and select the platform you want to share it with.

To share your Snapcode, simply let others scan the code via their phone's camera or tap **"Profile > Snapcode icon > Share Snapcode."**
