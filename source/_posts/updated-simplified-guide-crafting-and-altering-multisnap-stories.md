## Part1: How to Make Snapchat Multi Video Easily

 If you wish to make a multi video in a few minutes very quickly, you just need to tap the big round button on the screen of the camera app and hold it.

 Don’t leave the button even after the time is over. As you keep holding the button, the next snap starts recording automatically.

 When you think it’s complete, at the bottom of the screen you can see the snaps appearing.

 The ones you wish to keep must be saved and the rest can be dragged in order to delete.

 Finally, you may edit the snaps and add effects like you do with any usual snap at the same time.

2. Turn the Assistive Touch On from the of mode and then Create New Gesture, under Custom Gestures. With this mode, you can record the gestures. You can activate it from the Favorites in Menu bar. Then, use one finger to press and hold your iPhone screen’s center to allow recording your Touch. You can see at the bottom there’s a blue bar which once filled indicates that your Touch is recorded. Now, Save the gesture and open Snapchat. You can find a grey dot on the screen, tap it. Now, tap on the Custom and the saved gesture.

3. Once you click the saved gesture, you can see another grey dot on the screen. Drag the grey dot over record button of Snapchat and let go. One thing must be noted that you can only record 8 seconds video in iPhone than usual 10 seconds because gestures can be set only for 8 seconds.
