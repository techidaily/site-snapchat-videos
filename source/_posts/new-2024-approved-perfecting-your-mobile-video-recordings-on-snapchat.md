### 6.In iOS, how to send gif on snapchat Messages?

Using the GIPHY keypad on your iPhone, you can share GIFs straight to your pals via Snapchat chats. However, you must first activate the keypad.

2. To do just that, go over to the iPhone configuration menu and select “General” from the drop-down menu.
