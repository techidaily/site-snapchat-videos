If you’re a Snapchat user, you will have spotted the [emojis](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that appear in your friends list next to the names of your friends. These **Snapchat emojis** don’t simply remain the same forever, but instead change over the course of time, and the changes themselves are based on the way that you interact with your friend. Only you are able to see the emojis. The Snapchat emojis themselves include stars, hearts, faces and more.

* [**Part2: How to change the streak emojis on Snapchat**](#part2)
* [**Part3: How to get a Bitmoji on Snapchat**](#part3)
* [**Part4: Why to use Snapchat emojis**](#part4)

## Part 1: What do exactly the Snapchat emojis mean?

In this section, we will tell you all about the different emojis on Snapchat. If you’ve been wondering what the Snap emoji meanings actually are, read on. A Gold Star next to someone’s name means they have replaced your snaps during the past 24 hours. A Yellow Star means you are #1 best friends with one another. You will send your largest amount of snaps to them and vice versa.

A Red Heart snap emoji is used to say that you have been #1 Bfs for a fortnight without interruption, whilst a Pink Heart Snapchat best friend emoji tells that that this has been the case for two months. If you see a baby emoji, this means you have only recently become friends with the person.

Have you seen a Face with Sunglasses? This means the person is B.Fs with one of your best friends and you send plenty of snaps to someone that they send many snaps to. A Grimacing Face tells you that your #1 is also their #1 friend and that the person you send the most snaps to is the same person they send the vast majority of their snaps to.

The Smirking Face shows that you are one of their B.Fs without this being reciprocated. In other words, they send you many snaps but you don’t return the favor. A Smiling Face means that you are good friends with someone but they aren’t quite your #1 B.F.

## Part 2: How to change the streak emojis on Snapchat

If you’re not happy with the emojis that you are seeing or you feel that they are not accurate for the person in question, don’t worry – these can easily be changed. You can switch the emojis by taking the following steps.

* Open Snapchat and swipe down
* Tap Settings
* Tap Manage Preferences
* Tap Friend Emojis
* Tap the icon that you want to change
* Tap the emoji that you wish to use

## Part 3: How to get a Bitmoji on Snapchat

Snapchat purchased Bitmoji creator Bitstrips in 2016 in an attempt to capitalise on the popularity of emojis. It is now possible to link your Bitmoji account to your Snapchat one, and it only takes a few moments to connect the two. By doing so, you can enjoy greater customisation options and enhance the experience of using Snapchat.

Take these steps if you wish to get a personal Bitmoji on Snapchat.

#### 1\. Open your Snapchat settings

Swipe down on your home screen, tapping the gear icon located in the top right-hand corner of your screen.

You can find this in the ‘My Account’ section. Those that have already registered with Bitmoji will be able to link their account in the next step, but if you haven’t, you will need to set up a new Bitmoji account.

![bitmoji](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/bitmoji-setting.JPG)

#### 2\. Agree and connect

You will now be able to link your Bitmoji account up to your Snapchat account. This means you can easily share your very own Bitmoji character with your followers on Snapchat and make the experience of using the service even more fun and personal to you.

Everything is set up for you to make the most of linking Bitmoji to Snapchat. Your Bitmoji is now stored in your regular emoji tab and can be seen under the icon which resembles a face.

## Part 4: Why to use Snapchat emojis

There are many great reasons for using Snapchat. The platform first appeared way back in September and has attracted millions upon millions of users since then. Snapchat may be strongly associated with teenagers, but it is used by adults of all ages. When you use Snapchat, the content you share is more direct and personal and is only seen by the people you want to see it, for ten seconds only. Snapchat is great for privacy, and if anyone attempts to take a screenshot of your content you will be notified.

Another reason so many people use Snapchat is that there are no complex settings to leave you confused. It also simplifies the video calling process and makes it much less complicated than other video communication platforms. Snapchat has also become a major marketing tool for businesses around the world, allowing them to connect with and promote their services to a wider range of tech-loving users.

## Conclusion

More and more people are using Bitmoji to change the emojis on Snapchat. When you use Bitmoji to change your Snap emojis, you can make an excellent statement about yourself. Snapchat brings friends closer together, and it’s said that the platform had more daily users than Twitter in 2016\. The creators of Snapchat actually failed 34 projects before their innovation became a success, which shows that perseverance can pay off. Why not change your Snapchat emojis today?

## Part 4: Why to use Snapchat emojis

There are many great reasons for using Snapchat. The platform first appeared way back in September and has attracted millions upon millions of users since then. Snapchat may be strongly associated with teenagers, but it is used by adults of all ages. When you use Snapchat, the content you share is more direct and personal and is only seen by the people you want to see it, for ten seconds only. Snapchat is great for privacy, and if anyone attempts to take a screenshot of your content you will be notified.

Another reason so many people use Snapchat is that there are no complex settings to leave you confused. It also simplifies the video calling process and makes it much less complicated than other video communication platforms. Snapchat has also become a major marketing tool for businesses around the world, allowing them to connect with and promote their services to a wider range of tech-loving users.

## Building Brand Awareness: Best Practices for Snapchat

As one of the most popular social platforms, Snapchat provides a wealth of opportunities for businesses to promote their products and services. However, Snapchat marketing can be challenging, as the platform constantly evolves and changes.

This article provides an overview of **Snapchat marketing strategy,** including why businesses should market on this platform, what types of content to post, and how to measure results.

With the information available in this article, you will be able to create a strategy that works for your business and get succeeded.

![snapchat app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/snapchat-app.jpg)

## Part 1\. Snapchat Overview

Firstly, let's have an overview of Snapchat before we see how to draw your blueprint in Part 3 and Part 4.

Snapchat - founded by Evan Spiegel, Bobby Murphy, and Reggie Brown - is a unique messaging app because it allows users to send disappearing messages and photos. This feature has made the app popular with young people aged 13-34 who want to communicate without leaving a permanent record.

As of May 2022, Snapchat has [347 million daily active users.](https://www.statista.com/statistics/545967/snapchat-app-dau/#:~:text=How%20many%20daily%20active%20users,increase%20of%20over%2018%20percent.) That's impressive growth from its humble beginnings back in 2011\. With [monthly active users of 557](https://www.statista.com/statistics/272014/global-social-networks-ranked-by-number-of-users/), Snapchat is ranked as the 12th most popular social media platform.

Not only that, the number of [Snapchat daily video views is 18 billion,](https://www.omnicoreagency.com/snapchat-statistics/) making it the best platform to showcase your services/products and generate more income. However, all this is only possible with the right **Snapchat marketing strategy.**

## Part 2\. Why Should Business Market On Snapchat

So you are probably thinking why your business should be on Snapchat - because it's popular with teenagers and young adults. In fact, the platform has over 347 million daily active users, with **75%** being under the age of 34.

Therefore, if you're targeting a younger demographic, then Snapchat should definitely be part of your social media marketing strategy.

Another big reason is that Snapchat is incredibly engaging. The average Snapchat user opens the app at least 20 times a day and spends 25 - 30 minutes on the app each day, so that's a lot of potential exposure for your business.

Not only that, but since Snapchat is still a new field and opened up [ads to users in October 2014,](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/20/snapchat-messaging-app-ad-creepy-ouija) many big companies have not entered the market. This has created a huge opportunity for small businesses to market their products and generate leads to increase their sales.

With Snapchat, you can get discovered by users in their Discovery feeds or via Stories. Also, they can interact with your brand using the Geofilters, stickers, and lenses you've produced during your ad campaign.

For instance, Taco Bell created a filter for Cinco de Mayo. The filter received 224 Million views, which is insane. Nevertheless, this campaign kept users engaged and helped increase Taco Bell's sales.

### Track and Measure your Marketing Results

You've created a Snapchat marketing strategy and are ready to start reaching your target audience. But how will you monitor if your marketing efforts are successful? The key is to track and measure your results so that you can make adjustments as needed.

While Snapchat doesn't offer robust analytics data, you can track the following metrics to monitor the results:

* By checking the number of views on your stories and ads to see how many people are viewing them.
* Check the length of the Story that received more viewers and try to make future ads and stories of the same length.
* Monitor the number of views on your First Snap and Last Snap and check whether the views are increasing or not.
* Analyze Engagement (the number of screenshots or direct messages) on your ads and stories. This will clearly tell you about your performance.
* Check the completion Rate (percentage of users who watched your stories and compare it with the increase in sales to see whether you are performing well or not.

Apart from what has been mentioned above, we have also prepared you with a video about how to develop business on Snapchat. You can watch to facilitate your plan on that platform.
