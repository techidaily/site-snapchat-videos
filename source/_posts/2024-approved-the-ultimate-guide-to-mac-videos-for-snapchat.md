## What Are the Ideal Features of a Snapchat Video?

Snapchat is highly optimized for vertical viewing which means that all the content needs to be served in portrait aspect ratio instead of landscape used by YouTube and other video platforms. You need to ensure that every aspect of your video is perfect before you can upload it for Snapchat on Mac. Here are some of the key features that you must not forget.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/snapchat.jpg)

* **Resolution** \- The ideal resolution of a Snapchat video is **1080 x 1920** pixels which is known as full HD. This resolution will ensure that your video loads in the right way and remains sharp and crisp for an excellent viewing experience.
* **Video Format** \- The recommended video format for Snapchat clips is **MP4 and MOV. Y**ou can use either of those formats on your Mac.
* **Aspect Ratio** \- This is one of the key aspects of any video that determines the orientation of viewing. For a perfect Snapchat video, it is recommended that you keep the aspect ratio to **9:16**.
* **Video Length Size** \- Remember that Snapchat isn't like YouTube and serves an audience that wants micro-entertainment. This is why the recommended time for your video is **3 to 10 seconds** with the video size **not exceeding 32 MB**. Otherwise, the Snapchat audience may not respond well to your videos.

That is why it is crucial that your Snapchat video has all the ideal features so your audience can enjoy the viewing experience as intended instead of attempting to manipulate their phones to be able to see the video clearly. It will create an unpleasant and frustrating experience and your viewers might not stay with you.

## What Are the Ideal Features of a Snapchat Video?

Snapchat is highly optimized for vertical viewing which means that all the content needs to be served in portrait aspect ratio instead of landscape used by YouTube and other video platforms. You need to ensure that every aspect of your video is perfect before you can upload it for Snapchat on Mac. Here are some of the key features that you must not forget.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/snapchat.jpg)

* **Resolution** \- The ideal resolution of a Snapchat video is **1080 x 1920** pixels which is known as full HD. This resolution will ensure that your video loads in the right way and remains sharp and crisp for an excellent viewing experience.
* **Video Format** \- The recommended video format for Snapchat clips is **MP4 and MOV. Y**ou can use either of those formats on your Mac.
* **Aspect Ratio** \- This is one of the key aspects of any video that determines the orientation of viewing. For a perfect Snapchat video, it is recommended that you keep the aspect ratio to **9:16**.
* **Video Length Size** \- Remember that Snapchat isn't like YouTube and serves an audience that wants micro-entertainment. This is why the recommended time for your video is **3 to 10 seconds** with the video size **not exceeding 32 MB**. Otherwise, the Snapchat audience may not respond well to your videos.

That is why it is crucial that your Snapchat video has all the ideal features so your audience can enjoy the viewing experience as intended instead of attempting to manipulate their phones to be able to see the video clearly. It will create an unpleasant and frustrating experience and your viewers might not stay with you.
