Are you seeking help to recover Snapchat photos and videos from your Android phone? There are possibilities that your photos and videos are saved in some folder on your Android phone itself. Although one of the best ways to keep your Snapshot photos saved is by taking screenshots. But, you often forget to do that. Isn’t it? Not to worry. The data is at times stored in a specific folder on your Android phone. The files you receive usually ends with .nomedia. It is an extension which makes the videos and photos invisible.

When you use your phone quite often, the chances of saving the deleted content in a particular data location becomes high.

* You can search for com.snapchat.android folder
* Reach the cache folder
* Next search for two other folders in Cache that are -com.android.renderscript.cache and receive\_image\_snaps
