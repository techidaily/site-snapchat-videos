**Let's have a look at the most popular Snapchat filters for selfies as we all know there's a big range to choose from!**

Whenever the users are feeling energetic and motivated, they use the "fire sunglasses" filter. They want to show everyone that they're on fire, and there couldn't be a better filter than this. It provides the users with a pair of glasses with fire on the glass, which adds to the energy.
