## Enhancing Customer Engagement with Snapchat Tactics

As one of the most popular social platforms, Snapchat provides a wealth of opportunities for businesses to promote their products and services. However, Snapchat marketing can be challenging, as the platform constantly evolves and changes.

This article provides an overview of **Snapchat marketing strategy,** including why businesses should market on this platform, what types of content to post, and how to measure results.

With the information available in this article, you will be able to create a strategy that works for your business and get succeeded.

![snapchat app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/snapchat-app.jpg)

## Part 1\. Snapchat Overview

Firstly, let's have an overview of Snapchat before we see how to draw your blueprint in Part 3 and Part 4.

Snapchat - founded by Evan Spiegel, Bobby Murphy, and Reggie Brown - is a unique messaging app because it allows users to send disappearing messages and photos. This feature has made the app popular with young people aged 13-34 who want to communicate without leaving a permanent record.

As of May 2022, Snapchat has [347 million daily active users.](https://www.statista.com/statistics/545967/snapchat-app-dau/#:~:text=How%20many%20daily%20active%20users,increase%20of%20over%2018%20percent.) That's impressive growth from its humble beginnings back in 2011\. With [monthly active users of 557](https://www.statista.com/statistics/272014/global-social-networks-ranked-by-number-of-users/), Snapchat is ranked as the 12th most popular social media platform.

Not only that, the number of [Snapchat daily video views is 18 billion,](https://www.omnicoreagency.com/snapchat-statistics/) making it the best platform to showcase your services/products and generate more income. However, all this is only possible with the right **Snapchat marketing strategy.**

## Part 2\. Why Should Business Market On Snapchat

So you are probably thinking why your business should be on Snapchat - because it's popular with teenagers and young adults. In fact, the platform has over 347 million daily active users, with **75%** being under the age of 34.

Therefore, if you're targeting a younger demographic, then Snapchat should definitely be part of your social media marketing strategy.

Another big reason is that Snapchat is incredibly engaging. The average Snapchat user opens the app at least 20 times a day and spends 25 - 30 minutes on the app each day, so that's a lot of potential exposure for your business.

Not only that, but since Snapchat is still a new field and opened up [ads to users in October 2014,](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/20/snapchat-messaging-app-ad-creepy-ouija) many big companies have not entered the market. This has created a huge opportunity for small businesses to market their products and generate leads to increase their sales.

With Snapchat, you can get discovered by users in their Discovery feeds or via Stories. Also, they can interact with your brand using the Geofilters, stickers, and lenses you've produced during your ad campaign.

For instance, Taco Bell created a filter for Cinco de Mayo. The filter received 224 Million views, which is insane. Nevertheless, this campaign kept users engaged and helped increase Taco Bell's sales.

![taco bell cinco de mayo filter on snapchat](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/taco-bell-cinco-de-mayo-filter-on-snapchat.jpg)

## Part 3\. Where To Start Your Snapchat Marketing Strategy?

As a business owner, if you're not sure where to start with your marketing strategy, here are some tips and ideas to get you started:

A Quick Guide:

1. [Create Your Snapchat Business Account](#part3-1)
2. [Create Your Snapcode](#part3-2)

### Create Your Snapchat Business Account

Setting up a business account on Snapchat will help you access more features and special functions.

Some of the perks of creating a business account are:

* Access to Ads Manager for creating advertisement campaigns.
* Target your viewer based on their age.
* Advertise your product or services in a specific area with the Location-target feature.
* Get access to creating on-demand Geofilters.

Wondering how you can create a Snapchat business account, follow these steps in a sequence:

Step1 Install Snapchat from the [Google Play Store or App Store](https://www.snapchat.com/download) on your device. Launch the app, and if you don't have a Snapchat account, start by creating one.

Type all the relevant information, such as First Name, Last Name, username, birthday, phone number, and password, and tap **"Sign up and Accept/Continue."**

![creating snapchat account](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/creating-snapchat-account.jpg)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Select a username that reflects your brand.

Step2 Now, set up your business account by heading to [Snapchat Business Manager](https://accounts.snapchat.com/accounts/login?client%5Fid=ads-api&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fads.snapchat.com%2Finstant-setup) and use your regular account details to log in.

![snapchat business account](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/snapchat-business-account.jpg)

Step3 Set your legal business name, your name, your country, and the currency you would like to use. Click **"Sign Up/Get Started,"** and your account business account will be created.

### Create Your Snapcode

Snapcode is a badge similar to QR codes that users can scan via their phone to find you quickly. You can use these codes to link your website, add a logo, or display them in your ads to create brand recognition.

Do the following steps to set up snap code for your business account:

Step1 Launch the **Snapchat** app (your business Snapchat account) and on the top-left side of your screen, tap the **Ghost/Profile** icon.

Step2 Now, tap the **Settings** icons, find the **"Snapcodes"** option and tap it. Select the **"Create Snapcodes"** option, add your URL, and tap **"Create."**

Here are a few tips and approaches to help you create a Snapchat story that will capture your audience's attention:

* **Keep it short and sweet:** Snapchat stories are only 10 seconds long, so make sure your story is concise and to the point.
* **Use high-quality visuals:** Since Snapchat is all about visuals, use high-quality images and videos in your story.
* **Be creative**: Use Snapchat's unique features, such as filters and augmented reality, to create a story that is truly one of a kind.
