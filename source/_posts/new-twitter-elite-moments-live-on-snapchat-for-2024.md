**Introduction**

Snapchat is a social media service that has several fun options for users to express themselves. The service has launched several innovative features over the years and one of their latest and popular tools is cameos. It is a fun way that one can express themselves, with their own faces plastered on comic characters or on bodies of animals and so forth.

1. **What is a Snapchat Cameo?**

If you have been seeing your friends add their faces to fun emojis, cartoons, and other figures, you could do that too with this fun feature on Snapchat. A cameo is an option that allows you to add your face to comic characters or animals or even create funny videos with them. You become a star of looping, short videos that you can send across to your friends. It is a great way to express your emotions in moments. Instead of messages, **Snapchat cameos** are an innovative way to say hello, express your feelings, and so forth. It is possible to customize captions and add them to the cameos that you create.

These are easy to add and send in chat messages since it is an option that occurs next to the stickers. It is available on the apps created for Android and iOS devices. You can choose from more than 150 cameos which makes it a great feature.

Indeed, who would not want to have cool means to express themselves, their opinions, or tell their close friends what they feel? Snapchat offers several unique ways of expressing yourself. While you could attach videos or memes that express what you feel, with a cameo you can make that even more personalized and unique. Add your face to cool videos, animations, or pics. What’s more, you can add text in different fonts and with interesting effects. It is nothing short of creating a video by yourself. That too can be easily done in a matter of seconds, while you are on chat with your friends or loved ones.

1. **How to Use Snapchat Cameo?**

There are easy ways to get started when using **Snapchat cameos**. All you need is to tap on the button provided, on the sticker bar. It involves taking a selfie or choosing a picture or a video that you already have on your phone or tablet. If a friend has set up the feature in their Snapchat and is chatting live, it is possible to co-star in it together.

Here are simple ways to get started:

* Start by choosing a contact on the Snap list with whom you wish to start a conversation or want to send a pic or video using this feature. You will find the functionality while you are texting and adding effects to the conversation. For this reason, the function appears in the borders of the keyboard you use.
* Once the chat page opens up, find the face icon next to the chat bar which shows above the keyboard. This leads to the emoji page along where you will find the **Snapchat cameos** option at the bottom.
* You will find the cameo icon at the bottom of this section. It looks like a face with a + sign on it. This will lead you to create the cameo video or pic.
* It starts by activating the selfie camera. It aligns the face on the camera with an outline in blue. It will instruct you to take the selfie picture.
* You will then get options for adding filters to the cameo of your face. This can consist of pictures you have in your gallery or a repository of images and cartoons that the app provides. You could also source images from the internet or videos to use for this purpose.
* Once the filters are applied and captions added, you are ready to send across the cameo to your selected contact. The **Snapchat cameos** you create get added to the chat option directly.
* It is also possible to create a two-person cameo, especially if the person’s pics are available on your gallery of images. You can also add text to make the pics more expressive.

1. **How to Fix Snapchat Cameo Not Showing up?**

Users of the Snapchat app can use cameo as one of the innovative new features that help them add their faces to funny videos, cartoons, and so forth. However, in certain instances, the cameos might not show up. In such cases you can fix such issues with the following steps:

Here search for the Snapchat app. Here you could opt to uninstall and use Force Stop. Visit storage options and clear all data. You can then restart your phone. Once you open the app you could find the cameo issue resolved.
